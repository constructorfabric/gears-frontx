/**
 * Single source of truth for the FrontX ecosystem's boundary model.
 *
 * Both the depcruise rules (internal/depcruise-config/core.cjs, consumed by
 * `npm run arch:deps:core`) and the package.json edge guard
 * (scripts/package-edge-tests.ts, consumed by `npm run arch:edges`) derive
 * their layer membership and allowed-edge lists from this module, so the
 * import-graph check and the manifest check cannot disagree about what the
 * layering is.
 *
 * The model here is the ecosystem layer partition of `architecture/DESIGN.md`
 * §1.3: three layers — published libraries, templates, projects orchestration —
 * with membership defined by property, plus the two stated non-layer categories
 * (build internals; non-package code). Templates are hosted outside this
 * repository and resolved by versioned source-spec, so no template-side package
 * may appear in this file; the template owns and enforces its own internal
 * layering in `template-shell/.dependency-cruiser.cjs`. This is NOT the historic
 * L1/L2/L3 SDK -> framework -> react chain — that chain described packages
 * (`state`, `i18n`, `framework`, `react`, `auth`, `studio`) that emigrated to
 * the self-contained `template-shell/` tree.

/**
 * Published-libraries layer (DESIGN §1.3): units consumed as versioned
 * dependencies that do not drive a project's lifecycle. Keyed by directory name
 * under `packages/`, each carrying the layer's two independent properties:
 *
 * - `core` — the library must remain UI-framework-agnostic
 *   (`cpt-frontx-principle-agnostic-core`). Enforced by `core-no-react` over
 *   `CORE_SRC_PATTERN` below, so a `true` here is what puts the package under
 *   that rule; flipping it to `false` is an architecture decision, not a fix.
 * - `standalone` — the library declares no intra-ecosystem package dependency,
 *   with the single exception of the type-substrate port. Asserted against
 *   `ALLOWED_ECOSYSTEM_EDGES` by `arch:edges`, so a standalone library's
 *   allowlist cannot quietly grow a non-port runtime edge while the property
 *   still claims otherwise.
 *
 * The two are independent: a library may hold either, both, or neither.
 * `ui-kit` is the current example of the split — a React component library,
 * so not `core`, yet a full layer member that is `standalone`. Its import-graph
 * isolation is additionally carried by the `frontx-ui-kit-interim-*` rules in
 * the root `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` until its extraction PR replaces them with
 * the approved, traced dependency policy.
