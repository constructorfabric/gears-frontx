/**
 * FrontX Dependency Cruiser Core Configuration
 * Rules for the published libraries holding the `core` property — the
 * UI-framework-agnostic subset of the published-libraries layer
 * (architecture/DESIGN.md §1.3). Membership is the property, not this file's
 * choice: the source set derives from `PUBLISHED_LIBRARY_PROPERTIES` in
 * layer-constants.cjs.
 *
 * Core packages MUST have:
 * - NO @gears-frontx/* imports, with exactly one exception: the type-substrate
 *   port (gts-plugin -> mfes), the `GTS -- "type-substrate port" --> MFES` edge
 *   of the DESIGN §1.3 diagram.
 * - NO React imports (the substrate is UI-framework-agnostic —
 *   `cpt-frontx-principle-agnostic-core`).
 *
 * Replaces the former `sdk.cjs` (L1 of the retired SDK -> framework -> react
 * chain); the packages that chain governed now live in `template-shell/`
 * and are enforced by `template-shell/.dependency-cruiser.cjs`.

// so counting them here would report two pre-existing non-problems in `mfes` and
// `api` and pressure someone into reshaping working code. The exemption lives
// in `viaOnly` — a per-edge `to.dependencyTypesNot` only filters the edge the
// cycle is evaluated from, so the same cycle would still be reported from its
// runtime side; `viaOnly` requires every edge in the cycle to be runtime, which
// is exactly "the cycle survives to runtime". The rule keeps its name —
// `verify-guard-configs.ts` asserts base inheritance by that name.
