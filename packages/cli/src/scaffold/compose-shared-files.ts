 * marker is meant to hide inside a comment of any language. Scanning without

 * region key, so `identity:key` cannot be split from a trailing
 * comment-closer (e.g. an HTML comment's or a block comment's closing
 * token) by any rule guaranteed correct in general. Every existing manifest
 * and test fixture writes `identity:key` as
 * one whitespace-free token, so this scanner takes the marker token up to
 * the first whitespace as the boundary it CAN resolve, then splits that
 * token on the FIRST `:` — a template identity is a colon-free
 * package-style name, so the region key is whatever remains, colons
 * included. A marker whose key carries embedded whitespace, or whose
 * comment-closer touches the token with no separating space (so no
 * whitespace ever separates `identity:key` from the closing token), falls
 * outside what this scanner can resolve: it cannot tell where the key ends
 * and the comment-closer begins, because `cpt-frontx-feature-template-manifest`
 * — the sole owner of the region-addressing schema — declares no charset
 * restriction on a region key. Closing that gap is a manifest-contract change
 * (reserving a character, or requiring a separating space before any
 * comment-closer), not a scanner change, so it is left unsupported here
 * rather than "fixed" by a heuristic the contract does not license.
 *
 * A begin marker whose token has no `identity:key` separator, an end marker
 * whose token has no `identity:key` separator, a begin marker with no
 * matching end marker before end of file, or an end marker that closes no
 * block, is NOT silently skipped: all four are reported back via
 * `unlocatable` (review #500 round-2 P1-1, round-3 P1) so the caller can
 * refuse materialization by name rather than have that block's content
 * vanish from the composed output with no diagnostic. An end marker is
 * matched by PARSED identity/regionKey equality (`parseMarkerLine`), never by
 * substring containment, so a declared region key that is a prefix of another
 * declared key on the same path (e.g. "scripts" and "scripts-dev") cannot
 * close the wrong block (review #500 round-2 P1-2).
 *
 * Matching is NEAREST-FIRST and CONSUMING: begins are walked in on-disk order
 * and each claims the nearest still-unclaimed matching end after it, marking
 * that end claimed before the next begin searches — so an end marker can
 * close AT MOST ONE begin. Two begins sharing one `identity:key` and only one
 * matching end is therefore not silently misread as two overlapping blocks
 * sharing that end (which independent, non-consuming searches would produce):
 * the first begin claims the sole end, and the second is reported
 * `unterminated` on its own line (round-3 P1). Symmetrically, every end
 * marker that parses but is never claimed by any begin — because no matching
 * begin precedes it at all, or because an earlier begin of the same key
 * already claimed the only preceding available end — is reported
 * `orphan-end`; an end that DOES close a block is never also reported,
 * regardless of how many other begins or ends share its key elsewhere on the
