// Computes one already-applied target's deletion plan: which real on-disk
// paths under it are safe to remove (`toDelete`), and which must be
// preserved (`toPreserve`). Pure logic behind injected seams — no direct
// filesystem access here, matching every other scaffold/manifest module's
// convention (`manifest/validate-content-self-containment.ts`'s
// `ListPayloadFilesFn`, `scaffold/conflict-check.ts`'s `CanonicalizeTargetFn`,
// `scaffold/existing-content.ts`'s reader seams).
//
// The target's effective ownership — the six-term subtraction
// `cpt-frontx-algo-cli-scaffolding-uniform-apply`'s own `inst-ua-compute-
// ownership` step fixes — is computed by calling `effective-ownership.ts`
// directly rather than restating it: that module's own header comment names
// this algorithm's `inst-dp-compute-ownership` step as ONE of the two
// callers of the ONE shared formulation, and marks that step there,
// alongside `inst-ua-compute-ownership`, as the single implementation both
// invoke. It is not marked a second time in this file — calling the
// function is what realizes the step.
