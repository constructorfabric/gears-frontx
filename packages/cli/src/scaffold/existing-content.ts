// (`manifest/validate-content-self-containment.ts`'s `ListPayloadFilesFn`/
// `ResolveDeclaredExclusionFn`, `scaffold/conflict-check.ts`'s
// `CanonicalizeTargetFn`). The real fs-backed implementations of the two
// seams below are someone else's wiring, not this module's concern.
//
// This algorithm runs ONLY for a target already cleared by the pre-flight
// conflict check and NOT already recorded under its template's own
// `targets[]` entry (`cpt-frontx-dod-cli-scaffolding-existing-content-
// protocol`) — a recorded target is an idempotent no-op by that record
// alone and never reaches here. That precondition is the caller's to
// enforce; this module only reconciles whatever payload and on-disk content
// it is handed.

// its two content-reading walks apart from an ordinary file; it stayed
// private because nothing outside the adapter needed to know a given
// `ContentItem`'s content WAS the marker rather than real bytes. That
// stopped being true the moment this algorithm needed to treat "a symlink
// stands here" as a reconciliation-level fact rather than an adapter-level
// implementation detail: a symlinked DIRECTORY anywhere above a payload
// path has to make every payload path beneath it uncomparable, and only
// this module — the one place that walks the payload path set against what
// exists — can decide that. A value only the WRITER (the adapter) and the
// READER (this module) agree on has exactly one honest home: the module
// that reads it and acts on it, with the writer importing the constant
// rather than each side keeping its own copy that could silently drift
// apart. `adapters/fs-existing-content.ts` imports this export rather than

// path, and stops. That makes every payload path BENEATH that symlink
// invisible to the two-map lookup `inst-ec-if-exists` performs below:
// `existing.get(payloadPath)` returns `undefined` for a path the walk never
// produced an entry for, which is indistinguishable from "nothing has ever
// been written here" — so a payload path standing beneath a symlinked
