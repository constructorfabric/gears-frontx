 * The nesting-aware, fail-closed pre-flight target conflict check

 * geometry every caller that must check a target or a candidate path against
 * everything already claimed runs through identically: a staged batch's
 * targets (`assemble`/`apply`), or a single `ownership add` candidate. A
 * future `delete` and `upgrade` read the same geometry for their own plans,
 * but call it differently (a single already-applied target, not a batch) —
 * this function's contract does not change for them, only what they pass.
 *
 * Canonicalizes every target under check to a project-relative path first
 * (`inst-cc-canonicalize`), fail-closed: a target that cannot be proven to
 * stay inside the project root through a symlink or a `..` segment refuses
 * the WHOLE check with `INVALID_PATH` before any comparison runs, rather
 * than silently dropping just that one target.
 *
 * Then runs one nesting-aware intersection check over the canonicalized
 * batch plus everything already recorded: the same target claimed by two
 * different templates is a conflict; the same target claimed twice by the
 * same template is an idempotent no-op; an undeclared ancestor/descendant
 * relationship is a conflict unless the descendant lies at or inside the
 * ancestor template's declared `excludedSubtrees`; and a target landing
 * inside `projectOwnedRoots`, `.frontx`, a local origin folder, or a
 * reserved environment entry is always a conflict regardless of nesting
 * direction — the reverse (one of those landing inside the target under
 * check) is a permitted subtraction, never judged here at all.
 *
 * Every conflict found is collected before returning — never short-circuited
 * on the first one — so a refusal report names every contested ground in
 * one pass, before any file is written or any `projectOwnedRoots` entry is
 * added.
