// typed, possibly-moving `@ref` (`cpt-frontx-adr-source-spec-syntax`).
// `pinnedRef` is optional, and a bare `string` remains a valid `FetchFn`
// return value (the union's other arm) precisely so an adapter with nothing
// to report — `adapters/local-fetch.ts`, a `path:` origin's fetch is never
// even reached — needs no change: it already returns `Promise<string>`,
// which still satisfies this widened signature unchanged. This is the union
// choice over a clean break to `Promise<FetchResult>`: exactly one place in
// this codebase interprets the return value (`resolver/resolve.ts`'s
// `resolveRemoteOrigin`), so the "two shapes forever" cost of a union is
// borne by one function, while a clean break would force every test fake
// across this package (`grep -rn "fetchFn" packages/cli/src --include
// "*.test.ts"`) to wrap a bare string in `{ content }` for no behavioral
// gain — pure churn against files that never need to know a pin exists.
