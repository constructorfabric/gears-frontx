// caller deciding containment by bare string prefix while another decides it by
// path segment, which makes the same two paths overlap for one and not the
// other.

// A safe relative path: no surrounding whitespace, not absolute, no backslash,

// normalizing keeps one spelling per addressed location and keeps the value
// unable to climb out of the root it is resolved against.

// than one declaration and one concrete path.
//
// That is what makes the degenerate guard belong here and not in
// `pathWithinSubtree`: a declaration addressing no location nests with no
// DISTINCT claim, because there is no file it and another claim could both own.
// Without the guard `src//` would contest `src` — the one slash comes off,
// `src/` prefixes `src/`, and the check refuses an assembly over a claim from
// which `pathWithinSubtree` hands the assembler no file at all. The asymmetry
// that leaves `src//main.ts` inside `src` is deliberate and stays: there the
// value is a concrete content path, where a doubled separator still names a real
// file in a real directory. Refusing the degenerate declaration outright is the
// manifest contract's job, not this predicate's (issue #546).
//
// Two IDENTICAL claims are the exception the equality test carries, and it has
// to come first: `src//` against `src//` is one declaration two templates both
// wrote, which is the plainest contest there is. Letting the degenerate guard
// answer false for it would admit the assembly, and since `pathWithinSubtree`
// then scopes both contributions to no content item, seed would report success
// and write a provenance record for each template over a repository that
// received none of their files.
//
// Over two template identities this is the inventory's nesting check: identity
// is used as a path under the inventory root, so a scoped `@acme/tools` and an
// `@acme/tools/extra` occupy nested directories, and a bounded update of the
// outer one clears its directory recursively and takes the inner one's files
// with it, leaving the inner template listed in the index with nothing on disk.
// The guard cannot change that caller's verdicts — `isSafeRelativePath` rejects
// an identity with an empty segment, so no identity reaching here carries a
// slash for it to fire on.
// Over two manifests' exclusive-subtree claims it is the overlap the pre-flight
// conflict check refuses (`cpt-frontx-dod-cli-scaffolding-conflict-check`).
