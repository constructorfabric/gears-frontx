// The project state document's concrete shape —
// `cpt-frontx-contract-project-provenance` — and the injected I/O seams its
// atomic read/write algorithm (`cpt-frontx-algo-composed-provenance-project-
// state-io`) depends on. This feature is the OWNER of this schema
// (`cpt-frontx-dod-composed-provenance-contract-ownership`); every other
// feature that reads or writes `.frontx/project.json` cites these types
// rather than declaring its own.
//
// Deliberately a NEW directory, not `src/provenance/` — that directory holds
// the OLD per-template `.frontx/provenance.json` model (a SET of records,
// one per applied template, `provenance/types.ts`'s `ProvenanceRecord`),
// slated for deletion once callers migrate to this single-document model.
// The two are unrelated shapes that happen to share a similar name; keeping
// them in separate directories keeps that migration from confusing the two.
