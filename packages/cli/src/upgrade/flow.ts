// Both actor flows §2 describes — a forward upgrade and a restore — drive
// the SAME engine (`cpt-frontx-dod-upgrade-changeset-single-engine`): read
// the baseline, validate (`cpt-frontx-algo-upgrade-changeset-validate`),
// present, approve/decline, commit (`cpt-frontx-algo-upgrade-changeset-
// commit`), map every commit outcome to its own return. Restore is not a
// second implementation of any of that — it is this engine invoked with the
// name's recorded PRECEDING `{origin, version}` as the candidate and its
// recorded version supplied as the expected version to check
// (`ValidateInput.candidateExpectedVersion`), and the currently recorded
// entry as the baseline. `driveUpgrade` below is the ONE private driver both
// exported entry points call — never a second "present, approve, commit, map
// outcomes" formulation.
//
// `driveUpgrade` reads the project state document EXACTLY ONCE per call, and
// hands the freshly-read `entry` to a small `deriveCandidate` callback that
// is the ONLY thing distinguishing the two directions: forward always
// succeeds with the developer's own origin and no recorded expectation;
// restore succeeds with the recorded preceding pair, or reports
// `NOTHING_TO_RESTORE` when there is none. Neither direction reads the
// project state document a second time to work out its own candidate — a
// second read here would risk seeing a different document than the one
// `driveUpgrade` already committed to (however unlikely in practice, this
// engine's own discipline elsewhere is "read once, never re-derive from a
// second read of the same store").
//
// A GAP in the FEATURE's own numbered steps, filled here rather than
// silently worked around: neither flow's §2 step list spells out a distinct
// instruction for the case where validation returns its `noop` outcome — the
// forward flow's own `inst-if-no-target` only lists FAILURE reasons
// (unresolvable, identity mismatch, content conflict, target conflict), and
// falling through to `inst-present-changeset` for a `noop` would present a
// plan that does not exist. The lifecycle states (§4,
// `inst-st-read-to-noop`) and the acceptance criteria ("resolves to the
// name's already-recorded `{origin, version}` is an idempotent no-op") both
// require this branch to exist and to skip presentation/approval/commit
// entirely, so it is implemented here as an explicit branch keyed to no
// numbered `inst-*` id — reported as a spec gap in this checkpoint's
// handoff, not invented silently.

 * new preceding origin — which is exactly what makes a SECOND restore,
 * requested immediately after this one, toggle back rather than ever
 * reaching `NOTHING_TO_RESTORE`: that later call's own `deriveCandidate`
 * reads `entry.previous` fresh from ITS OWN read of the project state
