// Lands an APPROVED `UpgradePlan` (`cpt-frontx-algo-upgrade-changeset-
// validate`'s output, reviewed by the developer) through the staged write
// `cpt-frontx-adr-project-upgrade-mechanism` fixes. The ORDERING below is
// the entire correctness argument, not an implementation detail:
//
//   reclaim stale temp -> materialize every new temp file -> verify every
//   destination against what classification saw -> only then rename/unlink
//   -> commit {origin,version} atomically -> promote inventory -> refresh
//   the AI bundle
//
// Each rule in that chain exists to close one specific failure window:
//   - Materializing EVERY temp file before touching ANY destination means a
//     crash mid-materialization leaves every target exactly as it was
//     (nothing has been renamed yet) - `inst-com-materialize-temp`.
//   - Verifying immediately before the FIRST rename, rather than trusting
//     what classification saw minutes or hours earlier during developer
//     review, closes the window where a developer's own edit could land in
//     the interval between approval and commit - `inst-com-verify-
//     destinations`. It is a precondition check ONLY: it can refuse, but it
//     never recomputes the plan, so "reviewed equals applied" still holds.
//   - Landing the project-state write LAST, after every destination write
//     has landed, is what makes a crashed run's re-run converge instead of
//     refusing: the recorded entry still names the baseline until this
//     write lands, so re-running the identical upgrade sees every
//     already-landed path as already matching the candidate
//     (`inst-cls-if-unchanged`'s disk-equals-candidate precedence) and just
//     finishes the rest - `inst-com-commit-state`.
//   - Promotion and the AI-bundle refresh are two SEPARATE writes to two
//     SEPARATE stores that happen AFTER that commit point, on purpose: a
//     failure in either must never be allowed to unwind a transition that
//     has already committed, because both are re-derivable (by resolving
//     the now-recorded origin) while the commit itself is not - `inst-com-
//     replace-inventory` / `inst-com-refresh-bundle`.
//
// This is why a promotion/bundle failure and an in-TRY I/O failure are
// caught by two structurally DIFFERENT handlers below rather than one: they
// make OPPOSITE claims about the world (nothing committed vs. the
// transition stands committed), and folding them into one catch would make
// it possible to report one as the other.

 * covers files the engine WROTE, but it does not license deleting a file the
 * engine did not. Walking the unfiltered tree would unlink a developer's own

 * inside a `projectOwnedRoots` entry, an `excludedSubtrees` subtree, another
 * template's nested target or origin folder, or, for a target at the project

 * deliberately applies no skip list). Deleting a developer's file before their
 * approval has even been executed against is exactly the failure this step's
 * reserved-naming convention exists to make impossible.
 *
 * The boundary comes from the plan (`UpgradePlan.exclusionRootsByTarget`),
