// REWRITE (checkpoint 5): the prior shapes here described the retired
// region-union engine — `ChangeSet` with `clean`/`conflicts` entries carrying
// a `regionKey`, a `ProjectSnapshot` rollback carrier, and a
// provenance-record baseline. `cpt-frontx-adr-project-upgrade-mechanism`
// retires all three: granularity is the WHOLE FILE (no hunk, region-marker,
// or line-level representation anywhere in the plan), the baseline is the
// project state store's own `{origin, version}` entry rather than a
// per-instance provenance record, and reversal is carried by one recorded
// preceding `{origin, version}` rather than a retained content snapshot.
//
// These are the shapes every module of the rewritten engine shares:
// `./classify.ts` (cpt-frontx-algo-upgrade-changeset-classify),
// `./validate.ts` (cpt-frontx-algo-upgrade-changeset-validate),
// `./commit.ts` (cpt-frontx-algo-upgrade-changeset-commit), and `./flow.ts`
// (the forward and restore flows). They are declared in one place so the
// four never disagree about what a plan is.
