 * `createFsCopyBundleFn`'s own fix below has to defend against on the next
 * `apply`. `lstat` reports the entry AT that path without dereferencing it:
 * a symlink is "there" whether or not what it points to is, matching how
 * `assertPathWithinProjectRoot`'s own dangling-symlink handling (`./
 * fs-project-io.ts`) already treats a dangling link as a real entry rather
 * than an ordinary not-yet-existing path. Only `ENOENT` — nothing at all
 * standing at the path — means absent; any other `lstat` failure (e.g. a
 * permission error) propagates rather than silently reading as "no bundle
 * here", the same asymmetry `createFsUnlinkDiskFileFn` (`./fs-upgrade-io.
 * ts`) draws between "already gone" and every other failure. */

// SYMLINK-ABORT FIX (HIGH, reproduced against the built binary): replacing
// `.frontx/ai/<manifestName>/` with a symlink to a path inside the project
// that does not exist, then applying again, used to hand `fs.cpSync` a
// destination whose final component is a symlink. `cpSync` calls
// `fs.statSync(dest)` internally to decide whether it is copying onto a
// file or a directory; `statSync` DEREFERENCES a symlink, and dereferencing
// one whose target does not exist throws libuv's own `filesystem_error` —
// not a catchable `Error` a JS `try`/`catch` around this module's own
// `copyBundle` call ever sees, an uncaught C++ exception that aborts the
// whole process (`libc++abi: terminating due to uncaught exception`). No
// envelope is emitted, and by the time it aborts the payload for the NEW
// target may already be on disk while `project.json` still says `targets:
// []` — the crash lands after materialization, before the record write.
//
// Removing whatever stands at `dest` before ever calling `cpSync` is
// therefore not merely a crash-avoidance measure but the behaviour ADR 0031
// already assigns this path: "`.frontx` is excluded from every template's
// ownership... The CLI itself materializes that bundle as a CLI-owned
// step... No template ever claims this path through `excludedSubtrees` or
// any other ownership declaration; the CLI, not the template, is the sole
// writer and remover of `.frontx/ai/<manifest-name>/`" (`architecture/ADR/
// 0031-template-ownership-boundary-declaration.md`). Since nothing else is
// ever entitled to have placed content at this exact path, clearing
// whatever is found there — dangling symlink, live symlink, a real
// directory, or (the ordinary case) nothing at all — is the CLI reclaiming
// its own ground, not a destructive guess.
//
// STALE-MERGE FIX (PR review, below the reporting threshold there but a real
// hole): an earlier version of this function cleared ONLY a symlink and left
// a pre-existing real DIRECTORY standing, on the reasoning that `cpSync`'s
// recursive merge "handles that case correctly". A merge does not handle it
// correctly — it handles it SILENTLY. A file the previous bundle shipped and
// the new one dropped survives the copy, because a recursive merge only ever
// adds and overwrites, never removes. The path where that actually happens
// is already known and already reported: `delete` can fail to remove a
// bundle and says so through its own `aiBundleResidue`, leaving a real
// directory of the OLD bundle's files at exactly this path for the next
// apply to merge into. The result would be a bundle that is neither the old
// one nor the new one, with nothing in any report saying so.
//
// So the whole entry is removed, whatever it is. `fs.rmSync` decides what to
// remove by `lstat`, so a symlink is unlinked as a directory ENTRY — never
// walked into, never deleting whatever it points at — and a LIVE symlink's
// real target, reachable from elsewhere in the project, is left untouched
// exactly as before; only the stale reference at this one path is cleared.
// The containment guard in `createFsCopyBundleFn` has already refused a
// `dest` whose real (or dangling-lexical) target lands outside the project
// root before this ever runs, so the ground being cleared is always inside
// the project and always the CLI's own. `force: true` keeps "nothing there
// yet" — the ordinary first apply — a no-op rather than an ENOENT, matching
// `createFsRemoveBundleFn` below, which reclaims the identical ground the
// identical way.

/** Real `CopyBundleFn` — copies the source's bundle folder into the
 * destination verbatim, creating every parent directory the destination
 * needs. `fs.cpSync`'s own `recursive: true` walks the whole convention
 * folder (extension.json, guidelines/, workflows/, skills/ — whatever a
 * template's real bundle carries), so no bespoke walker is needed here.
 *
 * CONTAINMENT ESCAPE FIX: `dest` is proven to stay inside `destRoot`
 * (the project root every real caller passes here), symlinks resolved,
 * before anything is created or copied — `assertPathWithinProjectRoot`
 * (`./fs-project-io.ts`) is the ONE shared check every adapter that writes
 * into a project uses. `destRoot` is an ordinary argument on this seam
 * already, unlike `WriteFileFn`/`RemoveProjectFileFn`, so no factory-level
 * threading is needed here.
 *
 * DANGLING-SYMLINK-INSIDE FIX (fifth review round, reproduced against the
 * built binary): this called the literal `fs.mkdirSync(path.dirname(dest),
 * ...)` — the last of a class of two writers a prior round's fix missed
 * (`createFsWriteProjectFileFn`, `./fs-project-io.ts`, is the other) when it
 * claimed `resolveWriteParentDir` was already "the single formulation every
 * writer in this package shares". It was not, and the gap is the identical
 * defect `createFsWriteFileFn`'s own DANGLING-SYMLINK-INSIDE FIX already
 * closed there: a dangling `.frontx/ai/<manifestName>` symlink whose lexical
 * target resolves INSIDE the project root is deliberately ALLOWED by
 * `assertPathWithinProjectRoot` above, but the literal `mkdirSync(path.
 * dirname(dest))` creates nothing the link's resolved target needs — the
 * directory containing the link itself already exists. Reproduced live: a
 * dangling internal `.frontx/ai` link produced an uncaught `ENOENT` on the
 * literal parent, reported as `INVALID_PATH` by `apply.ts`'s own generic
 * catch only because that catch happens to fire on ANY thrown error here,
 * not because containment was actually the problem — the real cause (a
 * missing directory) was never the diagnosis the caller received. Now uses
 * the SAME `resolveWriteParentDir` walk `createFsWriteFileFn` and
 * `createFsWriteProjectStateFn` already call, never a fourth independently-
 * reasoned parent-directory resolution. */
