// readers that algorithm's pure logic depends on, matching every other
// adapter in this package's convention of one real adapter per injected
// seam type, kept in its own file since this concern (reading real file
// CONTENT, not just enumerating paths) is new: `adapters/fs-project-io.ts`'s
// `createFsListTargetFilesFn` and `adapters/fs-read-content-items.ts`'s
// `createFsReadContentItemsFn` each enumerate paths for a DIFFERENT
// existing purpose, neither returning the `{path, content}` pairs
// reconciliation needs to compare on-disk bytes against a template's
// payload.
//
// Deliberately simple, matching `adapters/fs-read-content-items.ts`'s own
// scope: a plain recursive `readdir`/`readFile` walk, no symlink-cycle
// handling (neither walk below ever descends INTO a symlinked directory, so
// there is no cycle to guard against). `readInstalledContent`'s
// installed-content-path enumeration mirrors that adapter's own walk exactly
// (a template's installed content is never a symlink farm) and, like it,
// still SKIPS a symlink dirent outright — that walk is unchanged by the fix
// below; `adapters/fs-project-io.ts`'s `createFsListPayloadFilesFn` is the
// sibling walker that resolves symlinks for a DIFFERENT algorithm (template
// content self-containment), and is not this one.
// `readExistingContent`'s target-directory walk intentionally applies NO
// skip list (no `node_modules` exclusion) for the identical reason
// `adapters/fs-project-io.ts`'s `createFsListTargetFilesFn` already gives for
// the delete-plan algorithm's own real-file enumeration: the six-term
// effective-ownership subtraction these seams feed
// (`scaffold/effective-ownership.ts`) names no such exclusion, and adding
// one here would silently add a seventh, undeclared term to that one
// shared formula.
//
// SYMLINK-INVISIBLE FIX (found in PR review, reproduced against the built
// binary): `readdirSync(..., { withFileTypes: true })` reports a symlink
// dirent as neither `isDirectory()` nor `isFile()`, so a symlink already
// standing at a TARGET path used to be skipped by this walk exactly like the
// "fifo, socket, or device" entries it was written to ignore. That made
// `readExistingContent` (this file's OTHER walk, feeding
// `reconcileExistingContent`'s "existing" side) blind to it: a declared
// payload path that a developer (or, one target over in the same batch, the
// pipeline itself) had already turned into a symlink aliasing a DIFFERENT
// on-disk file looked exactly like a brand-new path, and `commands/apply.ts`
// materialized straight through it, following the link into the aliased
// file and overwriting content `--adopt-existing` had promised to leave
// alone. `readExistingContent`'s walk below now reports a symlink dirent as
// an OCCUPIED existing entry — never silently dropped — while still never
// descending into it (matching this walk's own "deliberately simple, no
// symlink-cycle handling" scope, and the reproduced defect is a symlinked
// FILE, not a symlinked directory). `readInstalledContent`'s walk keeps
// skipping a symlink outright: a TEMPLATE's own payload is a different data
// source entirely (never expected to contain one), and is not this fix's
// target.

// where the disk holds a directory or a symlink instead of a regular file
// cannot be compared at all and refuses the same way, fail-closed, with
// CONTENT_CONFLICT."). Rather than attempt to read through a link that might
// alias another location entirely, resolve outside the project, or not
// resolve at all, `readExistingContent`'s walk below reports a symlink
// dirent as an EXISTING entry (occupying its path, so reconciliation never
// treats it as if nothing were there) carrying this fixed marker as its
// `content` — a value no legitimate template payload could ever author, so
// the entry can never land in `identicalFiles` and always forces the honest
// partition: `contentConflicts` when the payload declares this exact path,
// `additionalPaths` when it does not, for `--adopt-existing` to decide. The
// value is a CONSTANT (not e.g. a per-call random one) so that reading the
// same on-disk symlink twice — exactly what `commands/apply.ts`'s own
// adopted-path snapshot-then-reread verification does — reports it
// identically both times when nothing about that symlink actually changed.
//
// DIRECTORY-SYMLINK FIX (found in PR review, reproduced against the built
// binary): the marker's DEFINITION now lives in `../scaffold/existing-
// content.ts`, imported from there rather than restated here. A symlinked
// DIRECTORY anywhere above a payload path defeated reconciliation entirely
// (this walk never descends into a symlinked directory, so it never even
// reports an entry for a path beneath one — a gap distinct from, and worse
// than, the symlinked-FILE case this marker originally existed to cover);
// closing it required `reconcileExistingContent` itself to recognize "a
// symlink stands here" as a fact about the RAW read, before its own
// ownership filter narrows things down. A value both this adapter (the
// writer of it) and that algorithm (now also a reader of it) have to agree
// on has exactly one honest home — see that module's own doc comment on the
// constant for the full reasoning.

// `skipInstallOutput` distinguishes the two callers below, and the distinction
// is load-bearing rather than cosmetic:
//
//   - Reading a TEMPLATE's payload (`createFsReadInstalledContentFn`) must skip
//     `node_modules`, because the payload definition itself excludes it. This
//     repository's own `template-shell` is 428 MB across 32,813 files of which
//     529 are payload; reading all of it made `apply` copy install output into
//     the target, and made the resolver's own local-origin read exceed V8's
//     maximum string length when it encoded the folder as one bundle envelope.
//   - Walking a project TARGET (`createFsReadExistingContentFn`) must NOT skip
//     it: the six-term effective-ownership subtraction
//     (`../scaffold/effective-ownership.ts`) names no `node_modules` exclusion
//     for ground a template owns, and adding one would silently introduce an
//     undeclared seventh term — the exact reason
//     `createFsListTargetFilesFn`'s own comment gives for ITS empty skip set.
//
// `reportSymlinksAsExisting` is the SYMLINK-INVISIBLE FIX's own per-caller
// switch (this file's header comment) — `false` for `readInstalledContent`
// (a template's payload keeps skipping a symlink outright, unchanged), `true`
// for `readExistingContent` (a target's on-disk symlink is now reported,
// never silently dropped).
//
// One walk, two parameters, so no rule can drift apart into a second copy.
