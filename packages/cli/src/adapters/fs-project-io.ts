// SYMLINK-DESTINATION FIX (defect confirmed by PR review and reproduced
// against the built binary): `writeFile` below used to hand `destPath`
// straight to `fs.writeFileSync`, which follows a symlink at its FINAL path
// component exactly like it follows one at an intermediate component. When
// `destPath` was itself an existing symlink aliasing a DIFFERENT on-disk
// file — the exact shape `adapters/fs-existing-content.ts`'s own
// SYMLINK-INVISIBLE FIX now makes reconciliation able to SEE and refuse
// before ever reaching this point — a write through it silently overwrote
// whatever the link pointed at, which is precisely what `--adopt-existing`
// promises never to touch.
//
// This function is the last, narrowest place that promise can still be kept:
// it refuses outright when `destPath` already exists as a symlink, rather
// than replacing it. `adapters/fs-ai-bundle.ts`'s `createFsCopyBundleFn`
// replaces a symlink found at ITS destination instead — correct there
// because that destination (`.frontx/ai/<name>/`) is ground ADR 0031 already
// makes the CLI's own sole property, so nothing else is ever entitled to
// have placed a symlink there. A payload path materialized by THIS function
// is ordinary ground inside a developer's project, never CLI-owned — a
// symlink standing there may be the developer's own deliberate structure
// (see `fs-containment.test.ts`'s "a project may legitimately contain its
// own symlinks"), and this function has no way to tell that case apart from
// the aliasing defect above. Refusing is the only choice that cannot corrupt
// content on either side of that distinction.
//
// This check is orthogonal to `assertPathWithinProjectRoot`: that function
// (called separately, by `commands/apply.ts`, before this one) proves
// `destPath` itself resolves inside the project root, symlinks resolved — it
// says nothing about whether `destPath` ALREADY exists as a symlink, which
// is exactly the case an INTERNAL alias (the reproduced defect: the link's
// target was another file inside the same project) passes cleanly.
//
// Only the FINAL component is inspected here — an ANCESTOR directory
// component being a symlink is not this check's business, and was never
// closable at this seam: `writeFile` receives one absolute destination and
// no project root, so it has nowhere to stop walking up. That case is
// refused a whole phase earlier instead, by `scaffold/existing-content.ts`'s
// own DIRECTORY-SYMLINK FIX, which sees a symlinked directory standing
// between a target and a payload path and reports `CONTENT_CONFLICT` before
// materialization begins. Note what that means for a project deliberately
// structured through a symlinked directory (`app/src` -> `app/real-src`):
// it no longer applies a template through that link the way it once did —
// the batch is refused, fail-closed, and the developer resolves the link.
// That is a real behaviour change, made deliberately and recorded in the
// FEATURE's own acceptance criteria, because the alternative is the
// reproduced data loss: writing through a link the CLI cannot compare

// intermediate — see that function's own doc comment for why both shapes
// matter) — and reattach whatever never exists at all literally, once the
// walk runs out of real ground to stand on. An internal symlink — one whose
// real (or, for a dangling one, LEXICAL) target still resolves inside
// `root` — is deliberately ALLOWED, never refused outright: a project may
// legitimately contain its own symlinks, and only an escape past `root` is
// the defect this guard exists to catch.

// symlinks" (this file's own `resolveNearestExistingAncestor` header). But a
// write through such a link used to still fail with an uncaught `ENOENT`
// straight past every caller's error handling: every writer in this file and
// in `fs-upgrade-io.ts` creates missing parent directories with
// `fs.mkdirSync(path.dirname(absolutePath), { recursive: true })`, and
// `path.dirname` on a path THROUGH a symlink names the directory CONTAINING
// the link (which already exists — the link itself is a real directory entry
// there), never the directory the OS will actually land in once it follows
// that link. `mkdir -p app && ln -s app/missing/target.txt app/README.md`
// followed by a write to `app/README.md` passed containment (correctly —
// `missing/target.txt` resolves inside `app`) and then failed outright: the
// literal `mkdirSync(path.dirname('app/README.md'))` creates nothing
// `missing/` needs, since `app` already exists, and `fs.writeFileSync`/
// `fs.renameSync` then follow the symlink straight into a `missing/`
// directory that was never created.

// SYMLINK-ESCAPE FIX (found in PR review, reproduced against the built
// binary): this function used to walk UP from `lexicalCandidate` toward the
// filesystem root, one segment at a time, stopping at the nearest ancestor
// `fs.realpathSync` could resolve, then reattaching every segment below that
// literally as a plain name. That treated a DANGLING symlink — one that
// exists (an `lstat` on it succeeds) but whose own target does not
// (`realpathSync` on it therefore fails, exactly like a name that was never
// created at all) — as if it were an ordinary not-yet-existing path
// component, never as the link it actually is. `fs.writeFileSync` and every
// other write/remove syscall do not make that mistake: they follow a
// symlink's target on every component, dangling or not, so a dangling link
// pointing outside the project silently became the OS's actual write
// destination while this check kept comparing the wrong (literal,
// unresolved) path against the root — `mkdir -p app && ln -s /outside/
// nonexistent.txt app/README.md` followed by a write to `app/README.md`
// passed this check and landed on `/outside/nonexistent.txt`. The same gap
// applied to a dangling link in an INTERMEDIATE position, not only the final
// component: the old walk could climb straight past it as just another
// unresolved segment.
//
// The fix is to resolve the same way the OS does: left to right, one
// component at a time, from the filesystem root down, following every
// symlink found — dangling or not, final or intermediate — via `lstatSync`
// (which reports the link itself, never silently follows it the way
// `existsSync`/`realpathSync` do) and `readlinkSync`. A component that does
// not exist at all (`lstatSync` throws `ENOENT`) ends the walk: since a
// segment that has never existed cannot itself be a symlink, it and every
// segment still queued behind it are joined onto what has been resolved so
// far literally — this is the ordinary "about to create this path" case a
// write is expected to hit constantly, and it is handled identically
// whether or not any dangling link appeared earlier in the same walk. A
// component that DOES exist as a symlink — whether or not what it points at
// exists — is dereferenced via `readlinkSync`: an absolute target replaces
// the walk's position outright; a relative one is resolved against the
// symlink's OWN containing directory (`path.resolve`, which also collapses
// any `..` the target itself contains) — either way the walk then continues
// from the target, which may itself be another symlink, another dangling
// link, or ground further outside `root` still to be discovered. A cycle of
// symlinks is the only way this walk could fail to terminate, so the number
// of links followed is capped (`MAX_SYMLINK_RESOLUTIONS`) and the walk
