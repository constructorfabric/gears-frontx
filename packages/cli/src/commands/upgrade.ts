// `frontx upgrade <templateName> <new-origin>` / `frontx upgrade
// <templateName> --restore` — the command surface wired onto the rewritten
// engine (`../upgrade/flow.ts`). This module owns exactly what `commands/
// delete.ts` owns for `delete`: the human-interactive vs. `--json`
// confirmation protocol around one already-implemented plan-producing
// engine, never a second idea of what the plan or its commit mean. The
// engine itself (`upgradeToOrigin`/`restorePreceding`, `cpt-frontx-dod-
// upgrade-changeset-single-engine`) is untouched by this module — direct
// CLI use and any future external orchestration both drive it through this
// same command surface.
//
// `--json` reuses `delete`'s own precedent EXACTLY (`commands/delete.ts`'s
// own header, `inst-del-if-json-no-yes`): `CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED` when
// `--yes` is absent, carrying the computed plan, and the engine never blocks
// on stdin in this mode. No new error code is introduced for that —
// `CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED` is already part of the shared vocabulary
// (`envelope.ts`'s `ErrorCode`), and upgrade's own narrower
// `UpgradeRefusalCode` (`upgrade/types.ts`) deliberately has no dedicated
// equivalent for a decision the CALLER, not the engine, must make.
//
// HOW THE `--json`-WITHOUT-`--yes` SUBSTITUTION WORKS, without touching
// `flow.ts`: the engine's own `presentPlan` seam is the only place a
// computed plan ever reaches a caller before commit. In that mode,
// `presentPlan` is wired to return `'declined'` UNCONDITIONALLY — it never
// reads stdin — which drives the engine to its ordinary `{ok: true,
// outcome: 'declined', plan}` return (nothing committed, exactly as a real
// decline). This function then recognizes that SPECIFIC combination
// (`--json`, no `--yes`, an engine-reported decline) and reports it as
// `CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED` instead of an ordinary declined success — the
// plan the caller must re-approve travels back on the very same `outcome:
// 'declined'` value the engine already produced, so no second plan
// computation or capture mechanism is needed.
