## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Architectural Vision

The CLI (`@gears-frontx/cli`) is the ecosystem's only place where a template's lifecycle happens, and it is deliberately built to know nothing about any specific template. It bundles zero template content: every template it installs, registers, applies, or upgrades is resolved at runtime from an external source or a local `path:` origin by a versioned reference, through exactly one shared resolver that every command reuses rather than reimplements — the same resolver that pins a remote origin to the immutable commit or version a project depends on the moment it is registered. What a template is and what it owns is mostly computed, not declared: a template's manifest states only its identity, its required description, and the handful of subtrees within its own target it excludes from its own ownership; everything else in that target belongs to the template by default, and the CLI derives the rest algorithmically rather than reading a separately maintained boundary record.

Because independently authored templates, and a project's own reserved paths, all describe claims over one repository tree, the CLI treats every batch application as something that must be checked before it is trusted. A pre-flight conflict check canonicalizes every target, compares the whole batch against everything a project has already applied, and refuses a colliding batch before a single file is written — coincidence, undeclared containment, and reserved ground are all conflicts, never silently merged and never overridable. The same discipline governs change over time: a registered template's upgrade is validated against every target that template occupies and committed atomically to the project's single state document — every target moves together, or none do — never a silent rewrite of some targets while others are left behind, and never a whole-repository operation forced on templates that were not asked to move. Every command's machine-readable result, including a destructive delete's confirmation, is reported through one JSON envelope an AI agent can parse without learning a bespoke shape per command. The result is a command surface that stays decoupled from the content it scaffolds while making every mutation to a repository — and to the one document that records it — something a developer or an agent acting for one can see, approve, and inspect before it happens.

### 1.2 Architecture Drivers

#### Functional Drivers

| Requirement | Design Response |
|-------------|------------------|
| `cpt-frontx-fr-cli-template-install` | `cpt-frontx-component-cli-template-resolver` resolves a versioned source-spec, or a local `path:` origin, against the source registry and materializes the fetched template as tracked, addressable local inventory content, with zero template content bundled in the CLI distribution, and without registering it to any project. |
| `cpt-frontx-fr-cli-template-list` | The template resolver's catalog surface reports the platform's default templates, the templates the project has registered (read from the project state store), and the templates installed locally but not yet registered — each with its version and its manifest `description` — so a caller composes an explicit batch against full visibility. |
| `cpt-frontx-fr-cli-template-update-local` | The template resolver re-fetches a named entry by its recorded source-spec and replaces its materialized content in the local inventory only, leaving every project's registered origin and every scaffolded target untouched. |
| `cpt-frontx-fr-cli-template-validate-prepublish` | `cpt-frontx-component-cli-prepublish-validator` checks a candidate template's manifest against the thin, four-field manifest contract — `name`, `version`, a required non-empty `description`, and well-formed `excludedSubtrees` — before publication. |
| `cpt-frontx-fr-cli-template-registration` | `cpt-frontx-component-cli-registration` resolves and pins a remote origin to the immutable version it resolved to (or records a local `path:` origin as given), validates the manifest, and writes or confirms `templates[name]` in the project state store; it refuses `unregister` while `targets` is non-empty, listing every dependent target. |
| `cpt-frontx-fr-cli-project-state` | `cpt-frontx-component-cli-provenance-recorder` (the project state store) reads and atomically writes the single `.frontx/project.json` document — every registered template's origin, version, and applied targets, and the project's own `projectOwnedRoots` — as the one document every register, unregister, apply, delete, upgrade, and ownership command shares. |
| `cpt-frontx-fr-cli-seed-repository` | `cpt-frontx-component-cli-assembler`'s `seed` command wraps `apply` for a new or empty project only: it creates `.frontx/project.json`, auto-registers the batch's selected official default templates against the CLI's own built-in list of official origins (pinned on registration, as any other origin is), and then materializes the explicit, target-keyed batch into the empty repository in one operation, recording every applied target in the project state store. |
| `cpt-frontx-fr-cli-add-template-to-repository` | The assembler drives the same `apply` path against a repository that already holds applied templates, re-deriving and re-checking the batch's effective ownership against what is already applied before writing, and reporting `identicalFiles`/`contentConflicts`/`additionalPaths` for any target that already carries foreign content. |
| `cpt-frontx-fr-cli-template-boundary-declaration` | A template's effective ownership is computed algorithmically rather than read from a separately declared boundary record: it is the whole target minus the five subtractions CLI-5 (§2.2) enumerates, and the assembler and the conflict checker both derive it from the manifest and the project state store. CLI-5 is the single enumeration; this row names the rule, not a second copy of its terms. |
| `cpt-frontx-fr-cli-assembly-conflict-prevention` | `cpt-frontx-component-cli-conflict-checker` runs a nesting-aware, fail-closed intersection check over canonicalized targets — comparing the whole batch plus everything already applied — and refuses the whole batch before any write on same-target/different-template collision, undeclared ancestor/descendant containment, or a target landing on reserved project ground. |
| `cpt-frontx-fr-cli-ownership-management` | The CLI anchor dispatches `ownership add\|remove\|list` to mutate `projectOwnedRoots` in the project state store, gated by the conflict checker's geometry check against every applied target, without creating, moving, or deleting any file. |
| `cpt-frontx-fr-cli-project-upgrade-changeset` | `cpt-frontx-component-cli-change-set-engine` validates a registered template's new origin against every target it has been applied to and, on success, atomically updates that template's `origin`/`version` entry in the project state store — every target moves together, or none do. |
| `cpt-frontx-fr-cli-upgrade-review-approval` | The change-set engine presents the validated upgrade for explicit developer review and writes nothing to the repository or the project state store until it is approved. |
| `cpt-frontx-fr-cli-upgrade-restore` | A successful `upgrade` or `upgrade <templateName> --restore` records the name's one immediately preceding `origin`/`version`, so a restore itself leaves a fresh preceding entry — a second restore in a row is a redo that returns to where the first one came from, and only the generation before that is unreachable through the CLI. `--restore` runs the change-set engine in the other direction against the recorded entry, returning every target to the preceding origin's content within the preceding manifest's boundary — content the forward upgrade added into ground the candidate had newly claimed lies outside that boundary and stays in place, reported skipped — or refusing: `NOTHING_TO_RESTORE` when no preceding entry is recorded, `ORIGIN_UNAVAILABLE` when the preceding origin no longer resolves at all, `VERSION_MISMATCH` when it resolves but no longer reports the recorded version (`cpt-frontx-adr-project-upgrade-mechanism`). |
| `cpt-frontx-fr-cli-template-delete` | The assembler's `delete` path computes the deletion plan as the target's effective ownership (CLI-5's five subtractions, never a subset of them) minus any nested target belonging to another template, through the conflict checker's geometry; it requires explicit confirmation defaulting to no, supports a non-destructive `--dry-run` preview, and removes the target from the project state store on success. Deletion is bounded by effective ownership rather than by its own separate subtraction list, so a term added to CLI-5 is a term `delete` stops removing. |
| `cpt-frontx-fr-cli-machine-envelope` | Every command's `--json` mode reports one discriminated-union envelope (`{ok:true,data}` / `{ok:false,error:{code,message,details}}`) drawn from one stable code vocabulary, never blocks on interactive input, and represents a destructive confirmation as the `CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED` code rather than a prompt (§3.3, CLI-9). |
| `cpt-frontx-fr-versioned-platform-evolution` | The CLI publishes on its own semver line under the ecosystem's per-concern independent versioning policy, so a breaking change to its command surface is bounded to its own major version rather than forcing a lockstep release of any other artifact. |
| `cpt-frontx-fr-no-architectural-ceiling` | The CLI imposes no structural cap on how many templates a repository registers, applies, or how many are tracked in the local inventory; growth is governed by performance thresholds, not by the resolver, assembler, project state store, or change-set engine. |

#### NFR Allocation

| NFR ID | NFR Summary | Allocated To | Design Response | Verification Approach |
|--------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| `cpt-frontx-nfr-evolvability` | Versioned releases without lockstep upgrades | `cpt-frontx-component-cli-change-set-engine` | The single authoritative change-set engine treats a registered template's name — all of its targets together — as the unit of upgrade, validating a new origin against every one of that name's targets and atomically committing the origin/version transition to the project state store only on success, so a repository's registered templates adopt a newer version on their own cadence without a forced, destructive rewrite; the reviewed transition equals the applied transition. | End-to-end upgrade test asserting the committed `origin`/`version` equals the approved transition, that a declined upgrade writes nothing to any target or to the project state store, and that a validation failure on any one target leaves every target of that name unchanged. |
| `cpt-frontx-cli-nfr-no-ecosystem-coupling` | No intra-ecosystem edges; no bundled templates | The published package | The CLI's manifest declares no intra-ecosystem dependency, and every template is resolved from the source registry or a local `path:` origin by versioned reference at runtime rather than bundled into the tool. | The boundary guards (`arch:edges`, `arch:deps`) hold the manifest and import graph to the orchestration layer's rules; template externalization is asserted by the resolution FEATURE's tests. |

## 2. Principles & Constraints

### 2.1 Design Principles

#### Every Mutation Is Computed, Reviewed, and Reversible

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-cli-principle-reviewed-reversible-mutation`

No component in this package writes a repository file before its gate has passed. The assembler stages a batch's resolution, effective ownership, and the conflict checker's pass/refuse verdict as values, and stops short of any write until that verdict clears the whole batch — so materialization writes only behind a passed pre-flight check, and a `delete` plan is computed and shown before anything is removed. The change-set-and-upgrade engine is held to the same discipline as a design requirement: it validates a template's new origin against every target that template has been applied to as one atomic unit, and this principle requires that it commit the new origin and version to the project state store only after the developer reviews and approves that validated transition — never partially, and never before approval. The concrete review-and-approval mechanism that carries out this requirement for `upgrade` is the change-set engine's staged commit: it presents the computed changeset plan for approval and writes the new origin and version, and every target's files, only after that approval, atomically (`cpt-frontx-adr-project-upgrade-mechanism`).

This matters because independently authored templates and independently timed upgrades are both operations a developer cannot fully predict from the command line alone. Making "compute, review, then mutate" structural rather than a convention is what lets a refused batch leave zero files written — for the assembler and the conflict checker, that guarantee already holds today because there is no code path that skips the check, not because every caller remembers to check first. For `upgrade`, the same "review before mutate" discipline holds the same way: the change-set engine computes the plan, presents it, and writes nothing — to any target or to the project state store — until the developer approves it, and a decline or a validation failure on any one target leaves the whole name unchanged (`cpt-frontx-adr-project-upgrade-mechanism`). The concrete mechanism by which an applied upgrade is made reversible (`cpt-frontx-fr-cli-upgrade-restore`) is the same engine, reached as `upgrade <templateName> --restore`, run in the other direction against the name's one recorded preceding `origin`/`version`.

#### Template-agnostic tooling

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-principle-template-agnostic-tooling`

The CLI carries no bundled template or solution content. It resolves templates by versioned source-spec or local `path:` origin at runtime and applies every conforming template through the same lifecycle path.

#### Reviewable, non-destructive lifecycle

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-principle-reviewable-lifecycle`

CLI repository mutations are computed before they are applied. Assembly is gated by conflict checks, and an upgrade is represented as a reviewable, all-or-nothing transition before files or the project state document are written.

#### Ownership-bounded composition

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-principle-ownership-bounded-composition`

Every template owns its whole applied target by default, narrowed only by the extension points it declares and the exceptions a project reserves. The CLI computes and compares that effective ownership before materialization so independently authored templates, and a project's own files, can coexist without silent multi-writer conflict.

A sanctioned composition built entirely from this mechanism is **host pre-wires, guest nests into exclusion**: a host template that already occupies shared ground it expects to co-host others declares the *directory* a guest's target will occupy — a literal target-relative path ending in a trailing `/`, for example `packages/` — as `excludedSubtrees` in its own manifest, ahead of any guest being chosen. A guest template is then registered and applied *into* that declared exclusion; nothing here rewrites the host's own files or the project's `projectOwnedRoots` to make room for it after the fact. A shared configuration file the host owns for that same ground — a `package.json` carrying a `workspaces` array, say — is not itself an `excludedSubtrees` entry and stays host-owned; the host instead keeps that file's own discovery mechanism glob-open at the content level (`"workspaces": ["packages/*"]`), an npm-level convention internal to the file's content that the CLI knows nothing about, so a guest applied under the excluded directory is picked up without any file being rewritten to name it. If a shared configuration instead needs a named, per-guest entry, that write sits outside this mechanism entirely: a developer makes it, never the CLI — the AI-scaffolding step (`cpt-frontx-feature-ai-project-scaffolding`) is not an alternative owner here, since its own command-surface-only constraint (`cpt-frontx-dod-ai-project-scaffolding-command-surface-only`) prohibits it from materializing or modifying any project file as part of applying a template, and a host's shared configuration file is exactly such a file, not a unit an activated extension skill has just created. This is not a carve-out the conflict checker special-cases — it is the ordinary whole-target-minus-`excludedSubtrees` computation (CLI-5) exercised deliberately: a host template's author reserves in advance, through the same declaration every template makes for itself, where a co-resident guest is expected to land. Ownership computed this way is an accounting the CLI keeps for conflict detection and as the upgrade baseline, not a write-lock on the developer: post-install edits to any content file, including one a template owns, remain the developer's or an AI-scaffolding step's to make, and an upgrade's three-way classification decides what happens to such an edit per file: the edit stands where the new version does not touch that file, and the upgrade is refused with `CONTENT_CONFLICT` where both changed the same file (`cpt-frontx-adr-project-upgrade-mechanism`).

### 2.2 Constraints

#### CLI-1 — Template independence of the CLI

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-constraint-cli-template-independence`

The CLI (`@gears-frontx/cli`) has zero dependency on any template. It resolves templates by source-spec or local `path:` origin at runtime and bundles none, so the command surface is fully decoupled from the content it scaffolds.

**ADRs**: [Template Acquisition and Location](../../../architecture/ADR/0016-template-acquisition-and-location.md)

#### CLI-2 — One authoritative shared resolver

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-constraint-cli-shared-resolver`

The CLI resolves templates through exactly one resolver, shared across every install, register, apply, and upgrade; no command carries its own divergent resolution path. Acquisition by source-spec or local `path:` origin, and pinning a remote origin to its immutable resolved form, are owned by the single template-resolver component, so resolution and pinning behavior cannot drift by command. CI-enforceable invariant: every install, register, apply, and upgrade routes acquisition and pinning through the one resolver component and no second resolution implementation exists.

**ADRs**: [Template Acquisition and Location](../../../architecture/ADR/0016-template-acquisition-and-location.md), [How a Template Source Is Referenced and What a Stored Reference Holds](../../../architecture/ADR/0017-source-spec-syntax.md), [One Monolithic CLI Component Fuses Six Distinct Lifecycle Responsibilities](../../../architecture/ADR/0028-cli-internal-decomposition.md)

#### CLI-3 — Single authoritative change-set engine

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-constraint-cli-authoritative-change-set`

Every registered template's upgrade — atomically across all of that template's targets — is computed and applied by exactly one change-set engine; there is no second path that mutates a repository or the project state document. Reversal is reached on that same engine as `upgrade <templateName> --restore`, a flag rather than a second command, because restore is the identical engine pointed at the name's recorded preceding origin. The transition a developer reviews and approves is identical to the transition the engine commits — the reviewed transition equals the applied transition. CI-enforceable invariant: an upgrade test asserts the committed `origin`/`version` equals the approved transition, with no mutation reaching the repository or the project state document outside the engine.

**ADRs**: [How an Applied Template Adopts a Newer Version](../../../architecture/ADR/0021-project-upgrade-mechanism.md), [One Monolithic CLI Component Fuses Six Distinct Lifecycle Responsibilities](../../../architecture/ADR/0028-cli-internal-decomposition.md)

#### CLI-4 — Non-destructive, atomic, reversible upgrade

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-constraint-cli-non-destructive-upgrade`

An approved upgrade commits every target of the upgraded template's name to the project state document atomically — the recorded `origin`/`version` is all-or-nothing — and a declined upgrade writes nothing to any target and leaves that document unchanged. Immediately before the first rename, and only once every temporary file the plan needs already exists, the engine verifies that every destination the plan touches still holds exactly what classification saw; if any does not, it refuses the whole upgrade with `CONTENT_CONFLICT` and writes nothing, since no destination has been touched yet. This closes the window between computing the plan and landing it, but not the rename phase itself: a write that lands during that phase is not detectable by this check, and the repository's own version control is the remedy for it. Recovery from a failure the engine itself catches during the write phase returns every destination path it had already touched to its baseline content and leaves the recorded entry untouched; a hard crash runs no such recovery, and because the project state write is last, the recorded entry still names the baseline, so re-running the identical upgrade converges on the intended state rather than refusing — that, and the repository's own version control, is the remedy for a hard crash mid-write, not an automatic guarantee that every file is already back to baseline. CI-enforceable invariant: an end-to-end test asserts that a file changed by both the new origin and the developer refuses the whole upgrade with `CONTENT_CONFLICT` and writes nothing anywhere; that an edit landing after classification but before the first rename is caught by the pre-rename verification, refusing with `CONTENT_CONFLICT` and writing nothing; that a declined plan writes nothing to any target or to the project state document; that a caught failure during the write phase restores every path it had already touched to baseline and leaves the project state document unwritten; and that `upgrade <templateName> --restore` against the name's one recorded preceding `origin`/`version` reproduces the pre-upgrade state within the preceding manifest's boundary, leaving in place — reported skipped — any file the forward upgrade added into ground the candidate had newly claimed.

**ADRs**: [How an Applied Template Adopts a Newer Version](../../../architecture/ADR/0021-project-upgrade-mechanism.md)

#### CLI-5 — Algorithmic, whole-target ownership boundaries

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-constraint-cli-boundary-declaration`

A template owns its entire applied target by default. Its manifest may declare only `excludedSubtrees` — strict descendants of its own target where the author intends another template to nest; it declares no other boundary category. A template's effective ownership is computed as its target minus its declared `excludedSubtrees`, minus the project's `projectOwnedRoots`, minus the template's own local origin folder (when installed by local path), minus `.frontx`, minus the environment-owned entries (`.git`, `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`) at any depth within the target. Six terms in all, counted the way the rest of this corpus cites them: the target itself and the five subtractions from it. Another template's nested target is NOT among them — it is excluded separately, by the conflict checker's geometry, and `delete` subtracts it on top of this formula rather than as part of it. The environment-owned subtraction is unconditional: these entries belong to the developer's environment and to version control, so no ownership declaration may claim them and no `delete` may remove them. `projectOwnedRoots` are managed only through `ownership add | remove | list`: `add` accepts only an existing path and is refused when that path coincides with or is an ancestor of any applied target; neither `add` nor `remove` creates, moves, or deletes any file. Pre-publish validation checks that a template's declared `excludedSubtrees` are well-formed. CI-enforceable invariant: pre-publish validation rejects a template whose `excludedSubtrees` declaration is malformed or escapes its own target, `apply` refuses a template's own payload writing inside its own declared exclusion, and `ownership add` is refused when the target path conflicts with an applied target's geometry.

**ADRs**: [How a Template Declares the Boundaries of What It Owns](ADR/0031-template-ownership-boundary-declaration.md), [Template Manifest as the Published Conformance Contract](../../../architecture/ADR/0018-template-manifest-contract.md)

#### CLI-6 — Nesting-aware, fail-closed conflict prevention

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-constraint-cli-assembly-conflict-prevention`

Before any file is written, every target in a batch is first canonicalized to a project-relative path — a symlink or a `..` segment can never resolve outside the project root, and a target the check cannot prove stays inside the root is refused. The check then compares the whole batch against everything already recorded in the project state store: the same target claimed by two different templates is a conflict; the same target claimed twice by the same template is an idempotent no-op; an ancestor/descendant relationship between two targets is a conflict unless the inner target lies at or inside one of the outer template's declared `excludedSubtrees` entries; and a target landing inside a `projectOwnedRoot`, `.frontx`, a local origin folder, or an environment-owned entry (`.git`, `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`) is always a conflict. There is no `compatible declared merge` exception and no post-materialization honesty guard as a separate stage — the check that a template's own payload never writes inside its own declared exclusion runs pre-flight, before any file is written, as part of the same pass. `assemble` and `apply` both run this identical check over the full batch, and `delete`, `ownership add|remove`, and `upgrade` read the same geometry — an approved upgrade's transition is applied within a target's canonicalized effective ownership, never a redefinition of it; there is no `--force` override. CI-enforceable invariant: a batch with two boundary-intersecting templates — including undeclared containment — is refused with zero files written, and no code path bypasses the check.

**ADRs**: [Detecting and Preventing Conflicting Assembly Before Any Files Are Written](../../../architecture/ADR/0032-assembly-conflict-prevention.md), [How a Template Declares the Boundaries of What It Owns](ADR/0031-template-ownership-boundary-declaration.md)

#### CLI-7 — One project state document

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-constraint-cli-per-template-provenance`

A repository carries exactly one CLI-managed state document, `.frontx/project.json`, holding `formatVersion`, a `templates` map keyed by manifest name (each entry's `origin`, `version`, and `targets` array), and `projectOwnedRoots`. There is no per-applied-template provenance record and no second registry, provenance, or ownership file anywhere in the repository. `register`, `unregister`, `apply`, `delete`, `upgrade`, and `ownership add|remove|list` are the only commands that mutate it, and each reads and writes it atomically via a temp-file-plus-rename — a mutation never leaves the repository with a partially-written or a second, conflicting document. CI-enforceable invariant: assembling from N registered templates and applying M targets across them produces exactly one `.frontx/project.json` with one `templates` entry per registered name and every applied target under its name's `targets` array; a simulated interrupted write leaves the prior valid document, never a partially-merged one; and no second state file is ever written. (The constraint's identifier, `cpt-frontx-constraint-cli-per-template-provenance`, names a per-template provenance record this model does not have — the rule it fixes is the opposite, one document shared across every template. It is cited as it stands so existing citations resolve. Renaming it is tracked, together with three sibling identifiers whose names likewise misstate their scope, as a coordination work item in the root DECOMPOSITION, `cpt-frontx-feature-identifier-rename-wave`.)

**ADRs**: [Where a Repository Records Its CLI-Managed Template State](../../../architecture/ADR/0019-project-provenance-record.md)

#### CLI-8 — Registration and origin-pinning invariants

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-constraint-cli-registration-origin-pinning`

A template's identity in `.frontx/project.json` is its own manifest `name`, never a caller-chosen alias. `register` pins a remote origin to the exact immutable commit or package version its resolution settled on — never the typed, possibly-moving ref — and records a local `path:` origin exactly as given. Registering the same resolved origin twice is a no-op; registering a different origin for an already-registered name is refused unless `--replace` is given, and `--replace` itself is refused unless that name's `targets` array is empty. `unregister` is refused while `targets` is non-empty, listing every target that still depends on the name. CI-enforceable invariant: a fixture registering a remote origin whose `@ref` names a branch asserts the recorded origin is a commit SHA or exact package version, that re-resolving it later returns byte-identical content even after new commits land on that branch, and that `--replace` with a non-empty `targets` array is refused.

**ADRs**: [How a Template Source Is Referenced and What a Stored Reference Holds](../../../architecture/ADR/0017-source-spec-syntax.md) (what a stored origin holds and the `path:` form), [Where a Repository Records Its CLI-Managed Template State](../../../architecture/ADR/0019-project-provenance-record.md) (what keys an entry, `--replace`, and the unregister invariant), [Template Manifest as the Published Conformance Contract](../../../architecture/ADR/0018-template-manifest-contract.md) (the identity uniqueness rule the key relies on)

#### CLI-9 — Uniform machine-readable envelope

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-constraint-cli-machine-envelope`

In `--json` mode, every command emits exactly one JSON object on stdout as its last and only output: `{"ok": true, "data": {...}}` on success, or `{"ok": false, "error": {"code", "message", "details"}}` on failure or whenever a decision the command cannot make on the caller's behalf would otherwise require a prompt. `ok: false` always pairs with a non-zero process exit code, and `--json` mode never reads from stdin or blocks on a TTY. `error.code` is drawn from the one stable, finite vocabulary shared across every command that [What Every CLI Command's Machine-Readable Output Must Look Like](../../../architecture/ADR/0042-cli-machine-readable-output.md) enumerates and owns; the list is not restated here, so the vocabulary has exactly one place to be read and exactly one place to be amended when a genuinely new failure mode has to be named. Which command emits which code, and each code's exhaustive definition, belong to the FEATURE that owns that command's behavior (`cpt-frontx-adr-contract-schema-ownership`); every `RETURN`-path refusal in every FEATURE names a code from that vocabulary, and none returns an unlabelled failure. A destructive `delete` in `--json` mode never prompts: it returns `ok: false` with `error.code: "CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED"` and `details` listing what would be removed and preserved, and only proceeds on a re-issued call carrying explicit confirmation. CI-enforceable invariant: for every `--json`-capable command, a fixture asserts stdout parses as exactly one envelope value with no other output, that every `ok: false` fixture exits non-zero, that every refusal's `error.code` is a member of the vocabulary that decision fixes, and that a `--json` delete never reads stdin and never blocks.

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 Domain Model

| Entity | Definition | Representation |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| Template | An externally hosted, versioned unit resolved by source-spec or a local `path:` origin at runtime and bundled into no tool; it defines what it produces, and once registered resolves to exactly one immutable origin — a pinned remote commit or package version, or a project-local path — that a project depends on until an explicit upgrade changes it. A template owns its entire applied target by default, narrowed only by the extension points it declares. | Target — template repository content; reference and pinning owned by [How a Template Source Is Referenced and What a Stored Reference Holds](../../../architecture/ADR/0017-source-spec-syntax.md), identity and declared shape by [Template Manifest as the Published Conformance Contract](../../../architecture/ADR/0018-template-manifest-contract.md) |
| TemplateManifest | The descriptor every publishable template exposes in a defined shape — exactly its `name`, `version`, a required non-empty `description`, and `excludedSubtrees` — produced at pre-publish validation and consumed at install, register, apply, and assembly. | Manifest file (`frontx-template.json`) — role owned by this DESIGN, decision by [Template Manifest as the Published Conformance Contract](../../../architecture/ADR/0018-template-manifest-contract.md), concrete schema owned by [features/template-manifest/FEATURE.md](features/template-manifest/FEATURE.md) |
| OwnershipBoundary | A template's effective claim over its own target: the whole target minus its manifest-declared `excludedSubtrees`, minus the project's `projectOwnedRoots`, minus its own local origin folder, minus `.frontx`, minus the environment-owned entries (`.git`, `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`) — computed algorithmically rather than separately declared, and compared across the whole batch plus already-applied state to detect a conflicting assembly. | Computed at check time from the manifest and the project state document — role owned by this DESIGN, decision by [How a Template Declares the Boundaries of What It Owns](ADR/0031-template-ownership-boundary-declaration.md), concrete schema owned by [features/template-manifest/FEATURE.md](features/template-manifest/FEATURE.md) |
| Assembly | A repository extended by one CLI-driven operation — previewed statelessly by `assemble` and materialized by `apply` — from an explicit, caller-supplied, target-keyed batch naming each template and the target(s) it is applied to; the batch's effective ownership claims are checked for conflict, over canonicalized targets, before any files are written. | Materialized repository content; batch shape and no-saved-plan discipline fixed by [How Several Templates Are Applied Together into One Repository](../../../architecture/ADR/0020-composed-template-resolution.md), conflict geometry fixed by [Detecting and Preventing Conflicting Assembly Before Any Files Are Written](../../../architecture/ADR/0032-assembly-conflict-prevention.md) |
| ProjectProvenance | The single project state document, `.frontx/project.json`, recording every registered template's `origin`, `version`, and applied `targets`, plus the project's own `projectOwnedRoots`, so a later upgrade, delete, or ownership check reads one authoritative document instead of reconciling several. | In-repository document at `.frontx/project.json` — role owned by this DESIGN, decision by [Where a Repository Records Its CLI-Managed Template State](../../../architecture/ADR/0019-project-provenance-record.md), concrete schema owned by [features/composed-provenance/FEATURE.md](features/composed-provenance/FEATURE.md), whose scope matches this single-document model; renaming that FEATURE's identifier and folder to match is tracked as a coordination work item in the root DECOMPOSITION (`cpt-frontx-feature-identifier-rename-wave`) |

**Relationships**:

- Template → TemplateManifest: declares its published identity and its ownership exclusion points through a manifest.
- TemplateManifest → OwnershipBoundary: the manifest's declared `excludedSubtrees` is the one input to a template's effective ownership boundary that the algorithm cannot derive on its own.
- Assembly → Template: an assembly applies one or more registered templates, named explicitly in the caller's batch, to their targets — never a template's own manifest-declared reference to another template.
- Assembly → OwnershipBoundary: the batch's templates' effective ownership is compared — against each other and against the project's already-applied state — before any write.
- ProjectProvenance → Template: each registered template's entry in the project state document names its origin, its version, and every target it has been applied to.

### 3.2 Component Model

#### CLI

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-component-cli`

Concrete artifact: `@gears-frontx/cli`.

##### Why this component exists

Project Developers and the AI agents acting for them need to drive the full template and repository lifecycle — acquiring templates, registering a resolved origin under a project, applying a registered template to seed or extend a repository as an explicit batch, checking that batch for conflicts, keeping a project's entire registered-and-applied state in one document, managing project-owned ownership exceptions, upgrading every target of a registered template atomically, and deleting an applied target under explicit confirmation — from a single, predictable command surface that is decoupled from the templates it operates on. This component is the package-level anchor for `@gears-frontx/cli`: it owns the command surface, organized by lifecycle capability, and delegates each concern to one internal component, so the package reads as a set of single-responsibility parts rather than one fused unit ([One Monolithic CLI Component Fuses Six Distinct Lifecycle Responsibilities](../../../architecture/ADR/0028-cli-internal-decomposition.md)).

##### Responsibility scope

- Owns the command surface, organized by lifecycle capability — `install` / `register` / `unregister` / `list` / `update-local` / `validate` a template; `assemble` (stateless preview) and `apply` (materialize) an explicit batch to seed or extend a repository; `seed`; `delete` a target under confirmation; `upgrade` a registered template atomically across all its targets; `ownership add|remove|list` — dispatching each command to the owning internal component through one uniform mechanism that operates over any template ([Whether the Platform Classifies Templates or Applies Any Template Uniformly](../../../architecture/ADR/0030-uniform-template-mechanism.md)).
- Composes the internal components — template resolver, pre-publish validator, registration, assembler, conflict checker, project state store, and change-set-&-upgrade engine — into the lifecycle the command surface exposes.
- Holds the package's template-independence guarantee: it resolves templates by versioned source-spec or local `path:` origin at runtime and bundles none (CLI-1).
- Holds every command's `--json` mode to the one uniform result envelope — `{ok:true,data}` on success, `{ok:false,error:{code,message,details}}` on failure or a decision the caller must make — drawn from one stable, finite code vocabulary, with no interactive prompt reachable in that mode (CLI-9, [What Every CLI Command's Machine-Readable Output Must Look Like](../../../architecture/ADR/0042-cli-machine-readable-output.md)).

##### Responsibility boundaries

- Owns no lifecycle mechanism directly; acquisition, pre-publish validation, registration, assembly, conflict checking, project state, and upgrade are each owned by the corresponding internal component below. `ownership add|remove|list` is dispatched here but delegates its geometry check to the conflict checker and its persistence to the project state store, without a dedicated internal component of its own.
- The command surface operates identically over any template through one uniform mechanism ([Whether the Platform Classifies Templates or Applies Any Template Uniformly](../../../architecture/ADR/0030-uniform-template-mechanism.md)).
- Does not own the runtime mechanisms an assembled application uses (registration, type validation, communication) — those belong to the published libraries.
- Does not own AI-driven orchestration of upgrades; that is layered above the change-set engine by the AI Tooling kit and not duplicated here.

##### Related components (by ID)

- `cpt-frontx-component-cli-template-resolver` — composes (delegates template acquisition and pinning to).

- No intra-ecosystem package dependency. It operates on external templates that target the published libraries, with no compile-time coupling to any of them.

#### CLI Template Resolver

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-component-cli-template-resolver`

Internal component of `@gears-frontx/cli`.

##### Why this component exists

The CLI owns no template, so a single component must turn a versioned source-spec or a local `path:` reference into resolved template content, and must be the one place that pins a remote origin to the immutable value a project depends on. Concentrating all resolution and pinning in one component is what lets every install, register, apply, and upgrade share one authoritative path rather than each command carrying its own (CLI-2).

##### Responsibility scope

- Owns template acquisition by versioned source-spec or local `path:` origin (install), local listing of installed templates, and local update of the installed template store without touching any repository ([Template Acquisition and Location](../../../architecture/ADR/0016-template-acquisition-and-location.md)).
- Owns pinning a remote origin to the exact immutable commit or package version a fetch settles on, consumed by `register` when it writes `templates[name].origin`, and by `apply`'s and `upgrade`'s auto-install of a registered name whose content is not yet locally available ([How a Template Source Is Referenced and What a Stored Reference Holds](../../../architecture/ADR/0017-source-spec-syntax.md)).
- Reads the template manifest role to learn a template's identity (`name`, `version`, `description`) and its declared `excludedSubtrees`.

##### Responsibility boundaries

- Bundles no template (CLI-1); is the one shared resolver across every install, register, apply, and upgrade (CLI-2).
- Resolves any template through the same path regardless of its shape ([Whether the Platform Classifies Templates or Applies Any Template Uniformly](../../../architecture/ADR/0030-uniform-template-mechanism.md)).
- Does not decide what a project depends on by name (registration), materialize files into a repository (assembler), check boundaries for conflict (conflict checker), read or write project state (project state store), validate a candidate template for publication (pre-publish validator), or apply upgrades (change-set engine).

##### Related components (by ID)

- `cpt-frontx-component-cli` — internal component of (composed by).
- `cpt-frontx-component-cli-registration` — resolves, installs, and pins the origin for.
- `cpt-frontx-component-cli-assembler` — provides the resolved template content to.
- `cpt-frontx-component-cli-change-set-engine` — resolves an upgrade's new origin for.
- `cpt-frontx-component-cli-prepublish-validator` — shares template-manifest reading with.

#### CLI Pre-Publish Validator

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-component-cli-prepublish-validator`

Internal component of `@gears-frontx/cli`.

##### Why this component exists

A template must be checked against the manifest publication contract before it is published, so a structurally malformed template is caught by its author rather than by a consumer. This component is that pre-publish conformance check.

##### Responsibility scope

- Owns pre-publish validation of a candidate template's manifest against the thin, four-field contract (`cpt-frontx-contract-template-manifest`): a present `name`, a present `version`, a required non-empty `description`, and well-formed `excludedSubtrees` — each a strict descendant of the template's own target, with no `..` segment — producing a structural pass/fail conformance result ([Template Manifest as the Published Conformance Contract](../../../architecture/ADR/0018-template-manifest-contract.md)).

##### Responsibility boundaries

- Reads the manifest contract role only; the concrete manifest schema it checks against is owned by `cpt-frontx-feature-template-manifest`, per [Concrete Contract Schemas Left Unowned by Circular DESIGN↔ADR Deferral](../../../architecture/ADR/0027-contract-schema-ownership.md).
- Does not check whether a manifest's `description` accurately states the template's usage discipline — only that it is present and non-empty; semantic accuracy remains outside this component per `cpt-frontx-adr-template-manifest-contract`.
- Does not acquire, register, assemble, or upgrade.

##### Related components (by ID)

- `cpt-frontx-component-cli` — internal component of (composed by).
- `cpt-frontx-component-cli-template-resolver` — shares template-manifest reading with.

#### CLI Registration

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-component-cli-registration`

Internal component of `@gears-frontx/cli`.

##### Why this component exists

A project must depend on a template by exactly one name, resolving to exactly one immutable origin, before that template can be applied — and that dependency must be removable only once nothing still occupies the ground it named. This component owns registering and unregistering a template's origin under a project, keyed by the template's own manifest name rather than a caller-chosen alias, so every later command reads one authoritative name-to-origin mapping instead of reconciling a second, independently-chosen identity ([How a Template Source Is Referenced and What a Stored Reference Holds](../../../architecture/ADR/0017-source-spec-syntax.md)).

##### Responsibility scope

- Owns `register <origin>`: resolves the origin through the one shared template resolver — installing it into the local inventory first if not already available — reads its manifest's `name`, `version`, and required non-empty `description`, and writes or confirms `templates[name]` in the project state store. A remote origin is pinned to the exact immutable commit or package version the resolver's fetch settled on, never the typed ref; a local `path:` origin is recorded as given, because it has nothing external to pin against.
- Owns `unregister <name>`: removes a `templates[name]` entry only while its `targets` array is empty, and refuses otherwise, listing every target that still depends on it.
- Owns idempotency and the `--replace` invariant: re-registering the same resolved origin is a no-op; registering a different origin for a name that already has an entry is refused unless `--replace` is given, and `--replace` itself is refused unless that name's `targets` array is empty.

##### Responsibility boundaries

- Does not itself fetch or install template content beyond delegating to the template resolver (CLI-2); does not materialize files into a repository (assembler) or check ownership geometry (conflict checker).
- Does not change a name's origin once it has at least one applied target — that is the change-set engine's exclusive path (`upgrade`), never `register --replace`.
- Reads and writes only the `templates[name]` entry of the single project state document; it does not own that document's `projectOwnedRoots` section (ownership dispatch, via the CLI anchor) or the file-level effects of an applied target (assembler).

##### Related components (by ID)

- `cpt-frontx-component-cli` — internal component of (composed by).
- `cpt-frontx-component-cli-template-resolver` — resolves, installs, and pins the origin through.
- `cpt-frontx-component-cli-provenance-recorder` — reads and writes the `templates[name]` entry of the project state store through.

#### CLI Assembler

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-component-cli-assembler`

Internal component of `@gears-frontx/cli`.

##### Why this component exists

An explicit, caller-supplied batch of templates and targets must be turned into repository content — whether seeding an empty repository or extending one that already carries applied templates — and a repository must be able to shrink deliberately, under the same ownership geometry that governs assembly, without destroying another template's nested content or a project's own files.

##### Responsibility scope

- Owns `assemble`: a stateless preview of an explicit, target-keyed batch (`{"templates": {"<name>": ["<target>", ...]}}`) that runs the same resolution, effective-ownership, and conflict checks `apply` runs, and writes nothing ([How Several Templates Are Applied Together into One Repository](../../../architecture/ADR/0020-composed-template-resolution.md)).
- Owns `apply`: independently re-resolves and re-validates the same batch shape — never trusting a prior `assemble` run — and materializes it, seeding a new repository (`cpt-frontx-fr-cli-seed-repository`) or extending an existing one (`cpt-frontx-fr-cli-add-template-to-repository`). Re-applying the same template to a target already recorded under that template's `targets[]` in the project state store is an idempotent no-op determined solely by that recorded entry — by record, never by reading the target's on-disk content — so an edited-but-recorded target never blocks a batch retry.
- Owns the existing-content protocol, scoped to a target not yet recorded under any template's `targets[]`: when such a target already carries content `apply` did not itself place, it reports `identicalFiles`, `contentConflicts`, and `additionalPaths` separately, blocks on `additionalPaths` until the caller passes `--adopt-existing` or reserves the paths via `ownership add`, and never silently overwrites differing content. A payload path standing on, or beneath, a symlink is the one exception to `identicalFiles`: it is always `contentConflicts`, never a no-op, even when the link's target happens to hold byte-identical content — a symlink cannot be compared against declared text content, and writing through one lands somewhere the payload path does not name. A target already recorded never enters this reconciliation — the no-op above resolves it first, without touching disk.
- Owns the CLI-owned materialization of a template name's `.frontx/ai/<manifest-name>/` bundle — a step the assembler performs itself, never through any template's own ownership, because `.frontx` stays unconditionally subtracted from every template's effective ownership (CLI-5): the bundle is copied from the applying template's payload once, at the `apply` that gives that name its first target across the project; it is refreshed on `upgrade` when the new origin's payload carries a different bundle; and it is removed only when `delete` removes that name's last remaining target. The bundle is keyed per template name (per-identity), not per-target, so a second or later target added under an already-applied name never re-copies it.
- Owns `seed <dir> --input <batch>`: a thin wrapper around `apply`, valid only against a new or empty project. It creates `.frontx/project.json`, auto-registers the batch's selected official default templates — resolving, pinning, and writing each one's origin exactly as `register` would — from the CLI's own built-in list of official origins (links to templates, never bundled content, so this does not weaken CLI-1), and then applies the batch into the empty repository in one operation. That same built-in list is the source of the `defaults` section `list --json` reports.
- Owns `delete`: computes a target's deletion plan as that target's effective ownership (CLI-5's five subtractions, applied whole) minus any nested target belonging to another template, through the conflict checker's canonicalized geometry, and executes it only under explicit confirmation (defaulting to no) or the JSON envelope's `CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED` protocol, with a non-destructive `--dry-run` preview of exactly what would be removed and preserved.
- Triggers a write into the project state store as the final step of a successful `apply` (recording every newly applied target, and — when `seed` performed one — the registrations it made) or `delete` (removing the deleted target, and — when it was the name's last — the `.frontx/ai/<manifest-name>/` bundle).

**Three behaviors for foreign content.** Content the assembler did not itself place is handled differently depending on where, not what, it is: (1) payload that would land inside a `projectOwnedRoots` entry is skipped at write time and reported — that ground's protection is a matter of geometry the conflict checker already cleared, not a content question; (2) a target not yet recorded under any template's `targets[]` that already carries foreign content is reconciled through the existing-content protocol above (`identicalFiles`/`contentConflicts`/`additionalPaths`), because there its content, not its geometry, is what is contested; (3) a target that lands on reserved ground — `.frontx`, a local origin folder, an environment-owned entry, or another template's target — is a `TARGET_CONFLICT` refusal outright, decided before any write and never negotiated. `--adopt-existing` resolves case (2) only; because the conflict checker already refuses case (3) pre-flight, `--adopt-existing` can never cross reserved ground into a write.

##### Responsibility boundaries

- Does not acquire or resolve templates (template resolver) and does not itself own registration's origin-resolution and pinning logic (registration); `seed`'s auto-registration step drives that same registration component rather than reimplementing it.
- Does not decide whether a batch or a delete plan conflicts (conflict checker); it writes nothing until the pre-flight check passes, and computes a delete plan from the checker's geometry rather than its own.
- Does not apply upgrades to an already-registered template's origin (change-set engine); a deliberate overwrite of applied content is available only through `upgrade`, never through a repeated `apply`.
- Does not let a template claim `.frontx/ai/<manifest-name>/` through its own declared ownership; that path stays subtracted from every template's ownership (CLI-5), and the assembler's own materialization step above is the only writer of it.

- `cpt-frontx-component-cli-conflict-checker` — submits the staged batch and every delete plan to before writing.

#### CLI Conflict Checker

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-component-cli-conflict-checker`

Internal component of `@gears-frontx/cli`.

##### Why this component exists

Independently-authored templates, and the project's own reserved ground, all describe claims over the same repository tree, so two claims can coincide or one can contain another without either declaring the other. This component detects that before any file is written and prevents it, so a repository is never corrupted or silently clobbered by two conflicting claims.

##### Responsibility scope

- Owns fail-closed canonicalization of every target to a project-relative path before any comparison runs: a symlink or a `..` segment can never resolve outside the project root, and a path the check cannot prove stays inside the root is refused rather than passed through ([Detecting and Preventing Conflicting Assembly Before Any Files Are Written](../../../architecture/ADR/0032-assembly-conflict-prevention.md)).
- Owns the nesting-aware intersection check over the whole batch plus everything already recorded in the project state store: the same target claimed by two different templates is a conflict; the same target claimed twice by the same template is an idempotent no-op; an ancestor/descendant relationship between two targets is a conflict unless the inner target lies at or inside one of the outer template's declared `excludedSubtrees` entries; and a target landing inside a `projectOwnedRoot`, `.frontx`, a local origin folder, or an environment-owned entry (`.git`, `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`) is always a conflict.
- Owns the pre-flight check that a template's own payload does not write inside its own declared `excludedSubtrees` — a template cannot declare a hole and then fill it.
- Owns the identical geometry check `ownership add` runs against every applied target (refusing a `projectOwnedRoots` entry that coincides with or is an ancestor of an applied target), the geometry `delete` reads to compute what a deletion plan must preserve, and the same canonicalized effective-ownership geometry the change-set engine reads to bound where an approved `upgrade` transition is applied within each target — never a second, independently computed boundary.
- Reports every refusal as the stable `TARGET_CONFLICT` code, naming the contesting templates and the contested ground, never silently merging.

##### Responsibility boundaries

- Reads the declared `excludedSubtrees` from the manifest role and `projectOwnedRoots`/`targets` from the project state store; the concrete field layout of both remains owned by their respective FEATUREs, per [Concrete Contract Schemas Left Unowned by Circular DESIGN↔ADR Deferral](../../../architecture/ADR/0027-contract-schema-ownership.md).
- Does not resolve or acquire templates (template resolver) and does not itself write or delete files (assembler); it renders a pass/refuse verdict and a geometry answer, run identically by `assemble`, `apply`, `delete`, and `ownership add|remove`.
- Offers no override: an ownership conflict has no `--force`, and neither a template's `description` nor an AI layer choosing targets can bypass the check.

- `cpt-frontx-component-cli-provenance-recorder` — reads already-applied targets and `projectOwnedRoots` from.
- `cpt-frontx-component-cli-change-set-engine` — supplies its canonicalized effective-ownership geometry to, so an approved upgrade's transition is applied within each target's boundary rather than a second, independently computed one.

#### CLI Project State Store

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-component-cli-provenance-recorder`

Internal component of `@gears-frontx/cli`.

##### Why this component exists

Registration, applied targets, and the project's own ownership exceptions all key off the same template identity, and every lifecycle command needs to read and mutate that shared state atomically rather than reconciling it across separate documents. This component is the single authoritative store for a repository's entire CLI-managed footprint: every lifecycle command — `register`, `unregister`, `apply`, `delete`, `upgrade`, and `ownership add|remove|list` — reads and writes it, all sharing the one document ([Where a Repository Records Its CLI-Managed Template State](../../../architecture/ADR/0019-project-provenance-record.md)).

##### Responsibility scope

- Owns atomic read and write of the single `.frontx/project.json` document: `formatVersion`, the `templates` map (each entry's `origin`, `version`, and `targets` array), and `projectOwnedRoots`.
- Owns the presence/emptiness semantics that distinguish "registered" (an entry exists) from "applied" (its `targets` array is non-empty), which `register`, `unregister`, and `upgrade` all depend on.
- Is the one document every register, unregister, apply, delete, upgrade, and ownership command reads from and writes to; no second state file exists anywhere in the repository (CLI-7).

##### Responsibility boundaries

- Owns the document's role and its top-level shape and semantics; the concrete field-level JSON Schema is owned by `cpt-frontx-feature-composed-provenance`, per [Concrete Contract Schemas Left Unowned by Circular DESIGN↔ADR Deferral](../../../architecture/ADR/0027-contract-schema-ownership.md) — renaming that FEATURE's identifier and folder to match its current scope is tracked as a coordination work item in the root DECOMPOSITION (`cpt-frontx-feature-identifier-rename-wave`).
- Does not compute or apply an upgrade's validation or the atomic origin/version transition (change-set engine), does not compute ownership geometry (conflict checker), and does not resolve or materialize templates.

##### Related components (by ID)

- `cpt-frontx-component-cli-conflict-checker` — supplies already-applied targets and `projectOwnedRoots` to.
- `cpt-frontx-component-cli-change-set-engine` — supplies the `origin`/`version` baseline to, and receives the atomic post-upgrade commit from.

#### CLI Change-Set & Upgrade Engine

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-component-cli-change-set-engine`

Internal component of `@gears-frontx/cli`.

##### Why this component exists

Moving a registered template onto a newer origin must be reviewable and safe rather than a silent rewrite, and — because the project state store records exactly one `origin`/`version` pair per template name — it can never leave that name's targets at inconsistent versions. This component is the single authoritative engine that validates a new origin against every target a template name has been applied to and, only on a developer's explicit approval, commits the transition atomically across all of them ([How an Applied Template Adopts a Newer Version](../../../architecture/ADR/0021-project-upgrade-mechanism.md)).

##### Responsibility scope

- Owns `upgrade <templateName> <new-origin>`: reads the name's current `{origin, version}` entry from the project state store as its baseline, resolves the new origin through the template resolver, and validates it against every target currently listed under that name. The identical engine, invoked as `upgrade <templateName> --restore`, resolves the name's recorded preceding origin as its candidate instead — no `new-origin` argument — and runs the same validation in the other direction.
- Computes each target's boundary once, from the candidate manifest — the version whose content is being placed — through the conflict checker's canonicalized effective-ownership geometry, never recomputed per path and never mixed with the currently-applied manifest's boundary; a restore reads the identical geometry from the preceding manifest, since a restore's candidate is the preceding origin. The skipped set is defined over both payloads, baseline and candidate together, never the candidate's alone — ground the candidate newly excludes is typically carried only by the baseline, and scoping to the candidate's payload would silently drop exactly that ground from the report. Every payload path either the baseline or the candidate carries that falls outside that boundary, for any of those terms — the five terms CLI-5's effective-ownership subtraction names — an `excludedSubtrees` entry, a `projectOwnedRoots` entry, the target's own local origin folder, `.frontx`, an environment-owned entry — or another template's nested target, which is not one of them but a separate exclusion the conflict checker's geometry adds, exactly as this section's own `delete` description states it — is reported in the plan as `SKIPPED` and never written.
- Owns the all-or-nothing commit: on successful validation and explicit developer approval, it updates the name's `origin` and `version` in the project state store and applies the change within each target's effective ownership atomically — every target moves together, or the project state store is left exactly as it was for every target of that name. This project state write is the single commit point, landing only after every target's destination writes have; promoting the candidate's staged content into the name's local inventory slot is a separate write that follows the commit, never combined with it into one atomic write across the two stores — a promotion failure returns `INTERNAL` naming the slot it could not replace, and the committed transition still stands, because that content remains re-derivable by resolving the recorded origin.
- Is the one authoritative change-set engine in the ecosystem (CLI-3); the reviewed transition equals the applied transition (CLI-3, CLI-4).

##### Responsibility boundaries

- Reads the origin/version baseline from the project state store; does not itself resolve or acquire templates (template resolver) and does not compute ownership geometry (conflict checker).
- Owns the changeset plan's three-way whole-file classification — comparing the baseline (the name's currently recorded origin), the candidate (the requested new origin), and the on-disk content to classify every path within the computed boundary as `ADD`, `REPLACE`, `REMOVE`, `KEEP_LOCAL`, or `UNCHANGED`, and refusing the whole upgrade with `CONTENT_CONFLICT` for a path both sides changed — the staged write that applies an approved plan by materializing every `ADD`/`REPLACE` operation into a temporary file before any destination write, re-verifying immediately before the first rename that every destination the plan touches still holds exactly what classification saw (refusing with `CONTENT_CONFLICT` and writing nothing if not, since a precondition check never recomputes what was approved), and the one-generation reversal that restores the name's immediately preceding `origin`/`version` by running the same classification in the other direction (`cpt-frontx-algo-upgrade-changeset-commit`).
- Cannot move one target of a multi-target template forward while leaving a sibling target behind; that is a state the project state store's one-`origin`-per-name structure does not allow this engine to produce.
- Contains no AI workflow logic; AI-driven review, change-impact, and downstream-effect analysis are layered above it by the AI Tooling kit's upgrade-orchestration component, which orchestrates and does not reimplement this engine ([AI-Driven Upgrade Orchestration over a Single CLI Change-Set Engine](../../../architecture/ADR/0026-ai-driven-upgrade-orchestration.md)).

### 3.3 API Contracts

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-cli-interface-package-entry`

- **Contracts**: `cpt-frontx-interface-cli` (the executable command surface this package publishes), `cpt-frontx-contract-source-spec`, `cpt-frontx-contract-template-manifest`, `cpt-frontx-contract-project-provenance`, `cpt-frontx-contract-package-registry-distribution`
- **Technology**: TypeScript library API with declarations, plus a declared `bin` executable entry point built to run standalone
- **Location**: [src/index.ts](../src/index.ts) (library surface); `dist/cli.js` (the `frontx` executable named in `package.json`'s `bin`)

| Public surface | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| `installCommand`, `listCommand`, `updateLocalCommand`, `parseSourceSpec`, `resolveToInventory`, `TemplateInventory`, `InventoryIndex`, `InventoryStore` | Template acquisition by versioned source-spec or local `path:` origin, local inventory listing, and bounded local update through the one shared resolver; the same resolver performs the immutable pinning `register` and `apply`'s auto-install rely on. |
| `validateCommand`, `validateManifestContract`, `readManifestFromContent` | Pre-publish structure validation against the thin, four-field manifest contract (`name`, `version`, `description`, `excludedSubtrees`). |
| `registerCommand`, `unregisterCommand` | Registers a resolved origin under a project's manifest name, pinning a remote origin to the immutable version it resolved to and recording a local origin as given; unregisters a name only while its `targets` array is empty. |
| `listCommand` (catalog mode) | Reports the platform's default templates, the project's registered templates, and the templates installed locally but not yet registered — each with its `description` — for a caller composing an explicit batch. |
| `assembleCommand`, `applyCommand`, `seedRepository`, `addTemplate`, `uniformApply` | The one uniform batch path: `assemble` previews resolution, effective ownership, and conflicts statelessly; `apply` independently re-derives and materializes the same batch — seeding an empty repository or extending an existing one — including the existing-content protocol (`identicalFiles`/`contentConflicts`/`additionalPaths`, `--adopt-existing`) and idempotent re-apply. |
| `checkTargetConflicts` (replacing `checkAssemblyConflicts`) | The nesting-aware, fail-closed pre-flight check over canonicalized targets, run identically by `assemble`, `apply`, `delete`, and `ownership add|remove`. |
| `deleteCommand` | Computes and executes a target's deletion plan — the target's effective ownership (CLI-5) minus any nested target belonging to another template — under explicit confirmation or the `CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED` JSON protocol, with a `--dry-run` preview. |
| `ownershipAddCommand`, `ownershipRemoveCommand`, `ownershipListCommand` | Manage `projectOwnedRoots` directly against the project state store, without creating, moving, or deleting any file. |
| `readProjectState`, `writeProjectState`, `PROJECT_STATE_RELATIVE_PATH` | Atomic read/write of the single `.frontx/project.json` document — the one state every register, unregister, apply, delete, upgrade, and ownership command reads and mutates. |
| `upgradeCommand`, `computeUpgradeValidation`, `applyUpgrade` | The single change-set engine: validate a template's new origin against every target it has been applied to, gate the atomic all-targets update behind explicit review and approval, and commit `origin`/`version` to the project state store on success. |
| `frontx` (declared `bin`) | The executable entrypoint that parses `frontx <command> [args]` and dispatches to the library surface above through one uniform mechanism, rendering every command's `--json` mode as the single result envelope (`{ok:true,data}` / `{ok:false,error}`). |

**The contract to templates.** This package's artifacts own the ecosystem's three contracts to templates. Per [Concrete Contract Schemas Left Unowned by Circular DESIGN↔ADR Deferral](../../../architecture/ADR/0027-contract-schema-ownership.md), DESIGN owns each contract's role, the named ADR owns the decision rationale, and — where the contract carries a concrete field-level schema — the named FEATURE owns that schema.

- **Source-spec** (`cpt-frontx-contract-source-spec`): a versioned reference that identifies a template on the source registry, or a local `path:` reference naming a folder inside the project's own tree, resolved generically without prescribing a fixed syntax at requirement altitude. A remote reference is pinned to the exact, immutable commit or package version it resolves to at the moment a project registers it, so every later resolution of that project's registered origin returns the same content regardless of any later change to the reference's moving parts (such as a branch); a local origin has no external publication to pin against and is recorded as given. Stability: compatible across minor and patch versions; breaking changes follow `cpt-frontx-nfr-evolvability`. **ADRs**: [Template Acquisition and Location](../../../architecture/ADR/0016-template-acquisition-and-location.md), [How a Template Source Is Referenced and What a Stored Reference Holds](../../../architecture/ADR/0017-source-spec-syntax.md).
- **Template manifest** (`cpt-frontx-contract-template-manifest`): the descriptor every template publishes in a defined shape — exactly four fields: `name`, `version`, a required non-empty `description` carrying both selection and usage semantics, and `excludedSubtrees` naming the strict descendants of its own target where a nested template may be applied. The CLI checks a candidate template against this shape when it is validated for publication (pre-publish validator) and consumes it when a template is installed, registered, applied, or checked for conflicts with others (template resolver, registration, assembler, conflict checker). Stability: versioned with the platform; non-backward-compatible changes follow `cpt-frontx-nfr-evolvability`. Concrete schema owned by `cpt-frontx-feature-template-manifest`. **ADRs**: [Template Manifest as the Published Conformance Contract](../../../architecture/ADR/0018-template-manifest-contract.md), [Concrete Contract Schemas Left Unowned by Circular DESIGN↔ADR Deferral](../../../architecture/ADR/0027-contract-schema-ownership.md).
- **Project state (provenance) contract** (`cpt-frontx-contract-project-provenance`): the product records a project's entire CLI-managed template state — every registered template's name, origin, and version, every target it has been applied to, and the project's own ownership exceptions — in one project state file, `.frontx/project.json`, inside the repository (project state store), so a later upgrade, delete, or ownership check reads one authoritative document rather than reconciling several; current state is authoritative for the repository's registered and applied templates, and the document is mutated only by the product's own commands. Stability: the document's own structural shape is versioned independently of any one template's version and remains readable across product versions; non-backward-compatible changes follow `cpt-frontx-nfr-evolvability`. Concrete schema owned today by `cpt-frontx-feature-composed-provenance`, expected to be reassigned when the FEATURE layer covering registration, provenance, and ownership is reworked to match this model (§4). **ADRs**: [Where a Repository Records Its CLI-Managed Template State](../../../architecture/ADR/0019-project-provenance-record.md), [How a Template Declares the Boundaries of What It Owns](ADR/0031-template-ownership-boundary-declaration.md), [Concrete Contract Schemas Left Unowned by Circular DESIGN↔ADR Deferral](../../../architecture/ADR/0027-contract-schema-ownership.md).

### 3.4 Internal Dependencies

None. The package declares no runtime dependency in its manifest and imports no other package in this ecosystem — it operates on externally resolved template content that targets the published libraries, with no compile-time coupling to them ([Template Acquisition and Location](../../../architecture/ADR/0016-template-acquisition-and-location.md)).

**Dependency Rules** (per project conventions):
- No circular dependencies at the design level
- No intra-ecosystem package import from this package's source
- No import of any specific template's content

### 3.5 External Dependencies

#### GitHub source registry

| Dependency Module | Interface Used | Purpose |
|-------------------|----------------|---------|
| GitHub source registry (`cpt-frontx-actor-github`) | versioned source-spec fetch | Hosts the templates this package resolves and fetches by versioned source-spec at runtime, pinning a remote fetch to the exact immutable commit a project registers ([Template Acquisition and Location](../../../architecture/ADR/0016-template-acquisition-and-location.md), [How a Template Source Is Referenced and What a Stored Reference Holds](../../../architecture/ADR/0017-source-spec-syntax.md)). |

This dependency is shared with the AI Tooling Framework, which resolves its own kit content from the same registry through the AI tooling CLI integration rather than through this package's source-spec mechanism; this package's ownership of the registry is limited to template resolution.

#### npm package registry

| Dependency Module | Interface Used | Purpose |
|-------------------|----------------|---------|
| npm package registry (`cpt-frontx-actor-package-registry`) | package publish/install | Distributes this package under the ecosystem's per-concern independent versioning policy; consumers install it with their chosen package manager ([Artifact Versioning and Distribution Across the Ecosystem](../../../architecture/ADR/0001-artifact-versioning-and-distribution.md)). A package-registry-hosted origin is pinned to the exact package version a fetch resolves to, the same immutable-pinning discipline applied to a git-hosted origin. |

This dependency is not specific to the CLI: every published ecosystem package is distributed through it as the same channel.

**Dependency Rules** (per project conventions):
- No circular dependencies between components and external systems
- Only the template resolver talks to the source registry; no other internal component fetches from it directly

    else a target fails CONTENT_CONFLICT or TARGET_CONFLICT
        Eng-->>Dev: refuse the entire upgrade; templates[name] unchanged
    end
```

**Description**: The engine treats a registered template's name — every target listed under it — as one atomic unit. It reads that name's current `{origin, version}` entry from the project state store as its only baseline (there is no per-instance provenance record to read), resolves the requested new origin through the same shared resolver the rest of the package uses, and validates that new origin against every target the name has been applied to. Only if every target validates does it present the transition for the developer's explicit review and approval; approving commits the new `origin`/`version` to the project state store and applies the change within each target's effective ownership atomically — every target moves together, or the store is left exactly as it was for every target of that name. A decline, or a validation failure on any single target, leaves the repository and the project state document byte-for-byte unchanged for the whole name, never partially upgraded. `cpt-frontx-adr-project-upgrade-mechanism` fixes this validation and application step as a three-way whole-file classification, against a boundary computed once from the candidate manifest, that refuses with `CONTENT_CONFLICT` any path both the candidate and the disk have changed and with `TARGET_CONFLICT` when ground the candidate newly claims holds another template's nested target; the restore behind `cpt-frontx-fr-cli-upgrade-restore`'s reversibility requirement is reached as `upgrade <templateName> --restore` — the identical engine run in the other direction against the name's one recorded preceding `origin`/`version`, with its boundary read from the preceding manifest instead of the candidate's, returning every target to the preceding origin's content within that boundary and leaving in place, reported skipped, any file the forward upgrade had added into ground the candidate newly claimed. Other registered templates' entries in the project state store are never read or touched by this path.

```

**Description**: A Project Developer or an AI agent acting for one reads `list --json` — the platform's default templates, the project's registered templates, and the templates installed but not yet registered, each with its description — and composes an explicit, target-keyed batch naming exactly the templates and targets to apply; no manifest-declared reference between templates is ever resolved into that set ([How Several Templates Are Applied Together into One Repository](../../../architecture/ADR/0020-composed-template-resolution.md)). `assemble` is an optional, stateless preview of that same batch and writes nothing. `apply` never trusts a prior `assemble` run: it independently auto-installs a named template's registered, pinned origin if not yet locally available (through the one shared resolver, [How a Template Source Is Referenced and What a Stored Reference Holds](../../../architecture/ADR/0017-source-spec-syntax.md)), canonicalizes every target in the batch, and re-runs the nesting-aware, fail-closed conflict check against the whole batch plus everything the project has already applied ([Detecting and Preventing Conflicting Assembly Before Any Files Are Written](../../../architecture/ADR/0032-assembly-conflict-prevention.md)). Only if no conflict is found does it materialize the batch — applying the existing-content protocol (`identicalFiles`/`contentConflicts`/`additionalPaths`) to any target that already carries foreign content — and record every applied target under its template's entry in the project state store. A detected conflict, or an unreachable registry, is reported through the uniform JSON envelope (`TARGET_CONFLICT` and other stable codes, [What Every CLI Command's Machine-Readable Output Must Look Like](../../../architecture/ADR/0042-cli-machine-readable-output.md)) and refuses the whole batch before writing anything.

This flow also performs the CLI-owned materialization decided for `.frontx/ai/<manifest-name>/`: [How a Template Declares the Boundaries of What It Owns](ADR/0031-template-ownership-boundary-declaration.md) unconditionally subtracts `.frontx` from every template's effective ownership, so no template may write that path through its own ownership, and this sequence's `apply` step is the mechanism that fills the gap. After materializing the batch, `apply` checks — for each template name the batch gave a target to — whether that name had no target recorded before this call; for a name crossing from zero to one target, it copies that template's `.frontx/ai/<manifest-name>/` convention folder out of its payload as a step the CLI performs itself, never as part of the template's own ownership. The bundle is written once per name (per-identity), not once per target, so a second target added later under an already-applied name does not re-copy it; `delete` performs the mirror step, removing `.frontx/ai/<manifest-name>/` only when it removes that name's last remaining target.

#### AI-driven delete under the confirmation-required protocol

**Actors**: `cpt-frontx-actor-project-developer`

```mermaid

    participant AI as AI agent (--json)

    CLI-->>AI: {"ok": true, "data": {"toDelete": [...], "toPreserve": [...], "aiBundleResidue"?: {...}}}
```

**Description**: Delete is destructive, so `--json` mode never prompts and never blocks on stdin: a first call without explicit confirmation returns `ok: false` with `error.code: "CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED"` and `details` naming exactly what the deletion plan would remove and what it would preserve — the target's declared `excludedSubtrees`, any nested target belonging to another template, and any `projectOwnedRoots` entry beneath it — computed by the same canonicalized geometry the conflict checker uses for `assemble`/`apply` ([What Every CLI Command's Machine-Readable Output Must Look Like](../../../architecture/ADR/0042-cli-machine-readable-output.md)). A success carries one optional field beyond the two lists: the CLI removes the name's own `.frontx/ai/<manifest-name>/` bundle when it removes that name's last target, and if that one CLI-owned cleanup fails after the target's ground is already gone and the project state already records it, the outcome stays `ok: true` — the deletion happened and the document is correct — and names the surviving path in `aiBundleResidue` rather than reporting a failure over a completed deletion or dropping the residue silently. Having obtained the Project Developer's authorization out of band, the AI agent re-issues the identical command with `--yes`; the CLI recomputes the same geometry — never trusting the first call's result as a cached plan — and only then removes the target's owned ground and removes the target from its template's entry in the project state store. Withholding confirmation leaves the repository and the project state document unchanged; `--dry-run` produces the same delete/preserve lists without ever requiring confirmation, because nothing is at stake to confirm.

### 3.7 Database schemas & tables

Not applicable. The package holds no database. Its persistence is entirely file-based: the tracked local template inventory the resolver materializes on disk, and the single in-repository project-state document, `.frontx/project.json` — holding `formatVersion`, the `templates` map (`origin`, `version`, `targets` per registered name), and `projectOwnedRoots` — that every register, unregister, apply, delete, upgrade, and ownership command reads and writes atomically. Both are documented as entities in §3.1 and given their concrete field-level schemas by the template-resolution FEATURE and by `cpt-frontx-feature-composed-provenance` respectively (per [Concrete Contract Schemas Left Unowned by Circular DESIGN↔ADR Deferral](../../../architecture/ADR/0027-contract-schema-ownership.md)).

## 4. Additional context

This package is the ecosystem's largest member by component count: its eight internal components — the anchor plus seven single-responsibility internals — are cited here under the identifiers the root DECOMPOSITION and this package's own FEATUREs use, so every one of those citations resolves. Of the two sequences in §3.6, the upgrade sequence stays entirely inside this package's own components, while the assembly sequence records only the CLI-owned portion of a cross-package flow, leaving AI extension activation to the kit member.

The component model is the one the accepted decisions on template contracts and registration fix — `cpt-frontx-adr-template-manifest-contract`, `cpt-frontx-adr-project-provenance-record`, `cpt-frontx-adr-template-ownership-boundary-declaration`, `cpt-frontx-adr-composed-template-resolution`, `cpt-frontx-adr-assembly-conflict-prevention`, `cpt-frontx-adr-source-spec-syntax`, `cpt-frontx-adr-project-upgrade-mechanism`, and `cpt-frontx-adr-cli-machine-readable-output`. The CLI anchor `cpt-frontx-component-cli` composes seven single-responsibility internals: `cpt-frontx-component-cli-template-resolver`, `cpt-frontx-component-cli-prepublish-validator`, `cpt-frontx-component-cli-registration` — which owns `register`/`unregister` and the origin-pinning discipline those commands enforce — `cpt-frontx-component-cli-assembler`, `cpt-frontx-component-cli-conflict-checker`, `cpt-frontx-component-cli-provenance-recorder`, and `cpt-frontx-component-cli-change-set-engine`. Two identifiers in this chain read as a role their owner does not hold, and the discrepancy is stated rather than papered over: `cpt-frontx-component-cli-provenance-recorder` names a per-instance provenance-record role the component does not have — it is the project state store, owning the single `.frontx/project.json` document every lifecycle command shares (§3.2, "CLI Project State Store") — and `cpt-frontx-feature-composed-provenance` names a composed-provenance scope narrower than the project-state schema it in fact owns (§3.2, "Responsibility boundaries"). Renaming either one is a coordination work item in the root DECOMPOSITION (`cpt-frontx-feature-identifier-rename-wave`), not a change this DESIGN makes on its own: the identifiers as written are what every citation from the root DECOMPOSITION and this package's own FEATUREs resolves through, so they are cited here exactly as they stand.

`cpt-frontx-adr-project-upgrade-mechanism` fixes the decision, not invented in this DESIGN: the unit of an upgrade (a template name, atomically across all its targets), the baseline it reads (the project state store's `origin`/`version` entry), the changeset representation (a per-target, per-file plan of typed whole-file operations, alongside the payload paths skipped because they fall outside the computed boundary), the three-way whole-file classification that computes it against a boundary read once from the candidate manifest, and the one-generation reversal that undoes it, reached as `upgrade <templateName> --restore` (`cpt-frontx-fr-cli-upgrade-restore`). The staged write and failure recovery that carry that decision out on disk are owned by `cpt-frontx-feature-upgrade-changeset`. A registered local `path:` origin has no external publication to pin against, so its baseline is never reconstructed from a stored snapshot: the classification refuses with `VERSION_MISMATCH` whenever the recorded version no longer matches what that origin currently reports. `upgrade <templateName> --restore` applies the identical check to the recorded preceding origin: no preceding `{origin, version}` recorded for the name refuses with `NOTHING_TO_RESTORE`; a recorded preceding `path:` origin that no longer resolves at all refuses with `ORIGIN_UNAVAILABLE`; and one that resolves but no longer reports the version recorded beside it refuses with `VERSION_MISMATCH` — the honest outcomes for a local origin, rather than a fabricated restore against content nobody kept.

Three architectural facts follow from the accepted contracts, stated here independently of any implementation order. The ecosystem's existing templates (`template-shell`, `template-mfe`) predate the current contract and require direct conversion before they are installable under it: the four-field manifest (`cpt-frontx-adr-template-manifest-contract`), the pure-payload layout — the template directory holds only deliverable content plus the manifest and the conventional `.frontx/ai/<manifest-name>/` bundle, with authoring/dev-harness machinery extracted out of the template directory entirely — and a `description` meeting the authoring checklist. This is a direct conversion at the source, ahead of registration, and not merely the cheaper of two options: a manifest carrying any retired field (`schemaVersion`, `ownershipBoundaries`/`exclusiveSubtrees`/`sharedFiles`, `referencedTemplates`) is refused outright by every command that reads a manifest (install, register, apply, assembly), with no migration path of any kind — `cpt-frontx-adr-template-manifest-contract` fixes no runtime compatibility path for a legacy manifest to fall back on. `template-shell` and `template-mfe` must be converted before either is installable at all. This is the same treatment `cpt-frontx-adr-project-provenance-record`'s legacy `.frontx/provenance.json` receives — detected and refused outright, with no migration path — rather than a narrower case of a general migration rule: with this repository's own two templates as the only currently known consumers of the retired manifest shape, and their conversion tracked as a standalone coordination item below, a generic migration path would carry permanent compatibility surface for a third-party legacy template this repository does not have. Separately, every content-evolution path (`upgrade`, `register --replace` on applied names, re-applying changed content) funnels into the file-level changeset mechanism `cpt-frontx-adr-project-upgrade-mechanism` fixes; all three paths rely on the same three-way whole-file classification and staged write, never a bespoke mechanism of their own. Within this conversion, widening `template-shell`'s ownership from its current file-subset claim to whole-target ownership is itself a **behavioural change** requiring its own review, not a mechanical manifest edit; the full five-change scope of this conversion — for both templates — is tracked as a coordination work item in the root DECOMPOSITION (`cpt-frontx-feature-template-territory-conversion`), not invented or scheduled here. Third, bearing on `seed` in particular: those templates are not published anywhere outside this repository, so the CLI's built-in official defaults are generated as local `path:` origins resolvable only against this checkout. A CLI published from here therefore reports an empty `defaults` set in any other project — an unresolvable default is left out rather than reported with a guessed version, since that set's shape carries no slot for a resolution failure the way `installed`'s `manifestUnreadable` does — and `seed`, which accepts official defaults and nothing else, is correspondingly unusable outside this checkout. Where those templates are eventually published is not decided here, and this DESIGN records no such decision: the root DECOMPOSITION's own conversion work item (`cpt-frontx-feature-template-territory-conversion`) carries the deferral, states that completing the conversion does not by itself lift these consequences, and is the place a destination and a schedule would be recorded. Whenever that move happens, nothing in this design changes shape — the generator emits origins naming wherever the templates then live, and the ordinary resolver pins each at register time exactly as it pins any other remote origin.

The materialization of `.frontx/ai/<manifest-name>/` — a path no template may own, since `cpt-frontx-adr-template-ownership-boundary-declaration` unconditionally subtracts `.frontx` from every template's own ownership — is decided, not open: the CLI itself is the mechanism. §3.2 (CLI Assembler) and §3.6 (`cpt-frontx-seq-composed-project-scaffold`) describe the step — the assembler materializes a template name's `.frontx/ai/<manifest-name>/` bundle once, at the `apply` giving that name its first target, refreshes it on `upgrade` when the new origin's payload carries a different bundle, and removes it on `delete` of that name's last remaining target. The bundle is per-identity (one copy per manifest `name`), never per-target; the template itself still never owns the path, so that unconditional subtraction is not weakened by this mechanism.

**Testability seams.** This package defines no separate Testability Architecture section because its test seams follow directly from the component model already fixed in §3.2: the project state store's filesystem boundary (`.frontx/project.json` read/write, `readProjectState`/`writeProjectState` in §3.3) is the seam for injecting a test filesystem adapter instead of the real one; the template resolver's network fetch layer (the source registry and npm package registry lookups it alone performs, per CLI-2) is the seam mocked at the resolver's boundary so `install`, `register`, `apply`'s auto-install, and `upgrade` are tested without a live network; and the command surface's dispatch layer exposes each lifecycle operation as an injectable function — `installCommand`, `registerCommand`, `applyCommand`, `upgradeCommand`, `deleteCommand`, and their siblings in §3.3's public surface table — so a unit test drives a command directly without spawning the `frontx` process. No seam beyond what §3.2 and §3.3 already name is introduced here.

**Applicability of the remaining checklist categories.** **PERF** — addressed by reference: the concrete performance floors (inventory listing, batch assembly and conflict reporting, upgrade preparation) are owned by the PRD's `cpt-frontx-cli-nfr-template-scale`; the conflict checker and assembler (§3.2) are the components those thresholds bind. **SEC** — Not applicable as an authentication/authorization concern: the CLI is local developer tooling with no login surface, and `.frontx/project.json` (§3.7) holds only template identity, origin, version, and target paths, never secret material. **REL** — addressed: CLI-4 and CLI-7 (§2.2) fix the all-or-nothing upgrade guarantee and the atomic temp-file-plus-rename write of the single project state document as this package's reliability properties. **DATA** — addressed by reference for role and shape, not a complete schema: the project state document's role and top-level fields are fixed in §3.1/§3.7, and its concrete field-level schema is owned by `cpt-frontx-feature-composed-provenance` per ADR 0027 (§3.3). **OPS** — Not applicable: the CLI has no hosted deployment or runbook of its own; distribution is a package publish (§3.5, npm package registry) governed by the ecosystem's independent-versioning policy. **MAINT** — addressed: CLI-2 and CLI-3 (one shared resolver, one change-set engine) and the single-responsibility component model (§3.2) are this package's maintainability discipline, with `cpt-frontx-cli-nfr-discoverability` (PRD) as the developer-facing counterpart. **COMPL** — Not applicable: the CLI processes no regulated data category; `.frontx/project.json` records only template provenance. **UX** — addressed implicitly: CLI-9's uniform JSON envelope and the discoverability NFR (`cpt-frontx-cli-nfr-discoverability`) are this package's developer-experience contract. **INT** — addressed: §3.5 records this package's two external boundaries, the GitHub source registry it fetches templates from and the npm package registry it is published through; it integrates with nothing else, and reaches no other component except over a command surface. **TEST** — addressed by the "Testability seams" paragraph above, which states why this package declares no separate Testability Architecture section rather than omitting the question. **BIZ** — Not applicable at DESIGN altitude: product requirements are owned by the PRD and cited here only by ID.

## 5. Traceability

- **Features**: [features/](./features/)
- **Root chain**: [PRD](../../../architecture/PRD.md), [DESIGN](../../../architecture/DESIGN.md), [DECOMPOSITION](../../../architecture/DECOMPOSITION.md)

This package's requirements are owned by its own [PRD](./PRD.md), per the 3-layer model: each member explains its own reqs, and the root PRD describes the layers and the requirements binding every member equally. Every design element this package owns is cited under the identifier the root DECOMPOSITION and this package's FEATUREs use, so those citations resolve here.
