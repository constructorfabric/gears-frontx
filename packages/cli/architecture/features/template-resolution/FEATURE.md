## 1. Feature Context

- [ ] `p2` - `cpt-frontx-feature-template-resolution`

### 1.1 Overview

The CLI (`@gears-frontx/cli`) bundles no template and resolves each template from a versioned source-spec (`host:owner/repo[//subtree]@ref`) or a local `path:<relative-path>` origin naming a folder inside the project's own tree, materializing the template's actual files on disk in a tracked local inventory at an addressable installed content path — not a single manifest blob — so downstream apply and assembly read that content directly, and providing install, list, and bounded local update operations that never disturb already-scaffolded projects. The optional `//subtree` segment addresses a template occupying a subtree of a repository, so one repository can serve several templates; the acquired content is narrowed to that subtree and re-rooted, leaving a template unaware of where in a repository it lives. This same resolver is where a remote origin is pinned to the exact immutable commit or package version its fetch settles on — the value `register` writes into a project's `templates[name].origin` (`cpt-frontx-adr-template-registration-and-origin-pinning`, DESIGN §3.2 "CLI Template Resolver") — while a local `path:` origin has nothing external to pin against and resolves to whatever the named folder currently holds. A template is tracked under the identity its own manifest declares, not under the name of the repository it came from, and an install whose declared identity is already occupied by a different source is rejected before any inventory write rather than merged into the occupant's content path.

### 1.2 Purpose

This feature ensures the CLI command surface is fully decoupled from the content it scaffolds: templates are acquired by versioned reference at runtime, stored in a tracked local inventory, and updatable locally without affecting any scaffolded project. This realizes the CLI-1 design constraint and the template-agnostic-tooling principle.

**Requirements**: `cpt-frontx-fr-cli-template-install`, `cpt-frontx-fr-cli-template-list`, `cpt-frontx-fr-cli-template-update-local`

**Principles**: `cpt-frontx-principle-template-agnostic-tooling`

### 1.3 Actors

| Actor | Role in Feature |
|-------|-----------------|
| `cpt-frontx-actor-project-developer` | Installs, lists, and locally updates templates to maintain a reproducible local inventory for scaffolding |
| `cpt-frontx-actor-github` | Hosts versioned template repositories fetched by the CLI at install and update time via source-spec |

### 1.5 Machine-Readable Catalog Envelope

This feature owns the concrete shape of the listing command's `data` payload, because that shape is a **cross-boundary contract**: it is the surface over which the AI Tooling Framework obtains the selectable set (`cpt-frontx-feature-ai-project-scaffolding`) without linking the CLI or reading its inventory storage (DESIGN §3.4). A consumer on the far side of a process boundary cannot discover the shape by reading the producer's types, so the shape is fixed here rather than left to whichever formatter happens to emit it - the same reason `cpt-frontx-feature-template-manifest` fixes the manifest's field-level schema in its own §1.2 and `cpt-frontx-feature-template-ai-extensions` fixes the bundle convention in its §1.5.

**Request**: the listing command invoked with the `--json` flag. Absent the flag, the human-readable form is emitted unchanged; the two forms never mix on one invocation.

**Response**: the outer shape is the one uniform envelope every CLI command's `--json` mode emits - `{"ok": true, "data": {...}}` on success, `{"ok": false, "error": {"code", "message", "details"}}` on failure - fixed once for the whole command surface by `cpt-frontx-adr-uniform-cli-json-envelope` (CLI-9) and not redefined here. This feature no longer fixes a bespoke top-level shape or its own success discriminant; it fixes only the `data` payload's field-level content on success, per `cpt-frontx-adr-contract-schema-ownership`.

On success, `data` reports the three sets a caller composing an explicit batch needs visibility into side by side, each entry carrying its `description` (`cpt-frontx-adr-template-registration-and-origin-pinning`, "Catalog visibility"):

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    "defaults": [{"name": "...", "version": "...", "description": "..."}],
    "registered": [{"name": "...", "origin": "...", "version": "...", "targets": ["..."], "description": "..."}],
    "installed": [{"name": "...", "origin": "...", "version": "...", "description": "..."}]
  }
}
```

- `defaults` - the platform's default templates, listed independently of the current project's `.frontx/project.json`.
- `registered` - one record per entry in the current project's `templates` map: the manifest name that keys it, its pinned `origin` (immutable for a remote origin, the literal path for a `path:` origin), its registered `version`, and the `targets` it has been applied to.
- `installed` - templates present in the local inventory but not (yet) registered to this project, each with the canonical origin `install` resolved it to.
- Every entry in every set carries `description`, the same manifest-declared field that carries selection semantics (`cpt-frontx-adr-thin-template-manifest`). Under the current manifest contract `description` is required and non-empty (`cpt-frontx-feature-template-manifest`), so a conforming entry always declares one; **the key is absent, never empty and never a placeholder, only for a legacy-installed entry** - one materialized before `description` became required and read only through the isolated migration path `cpt-frontx-adr-thin-template-manifest` fixes for the retired five-category shape - a consumer selects templates by this value, and a substituted placeholder would be indistinguishable from a declaration the template never made.
- An empty set is reported as `[]`, never an absent key.

On failure, the command emits `{"ok": false, "error": {"code": ..., "message": ..., "details": {...}}}` with `error.code` drawn from the one stable vocabulary shared by every command - `INVALID_MANIFEST`, `VERSION_MISMATCH`, `TEMPLATE_NOT_REGISTERED`, `TARGET_CONFLICT`, `CONTENT_CONFLICT`, `EXISTING_PATHS_REQUIRE_DECISION`, `CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED`, `ORIGIN_UNAVAILABLE`, `PROJECT_INVALID` (`cpt-frontx-adr-uniform-cli-json-envelope`) - never a code this feature invents on its own. An unreadable `.frontx/project.json` is reported as `PROJECT_INVALID`, so a listing failure and a listing success are structurally distinguishable by `ok` rather than by an inventory-shaped absence.

The `data` payload's key names are the contract this feature owns; renaming one is a breaking change to the AI Tooling Framework's read path even though no compile-time edge would report it. The envelope's outer shape, its `ok` discriminant, and the `error.code` vocabulary are `cpt-frontx-adr-uniform-cli-json-envelope`'s contract, not this feature's, and are referenced rather than restated.

## 2. Actor Flows (CDSL)

User-facing interactions that start with an actor (human or external system) and describe the end-to-end flow of a use case. Each flow has a triggering actor and shows how the system responds to actor actions.

**Use cases**: `cpt-frontx-usecase-scaffold-composed-project`

### Install Template by Versioned Source-Spec

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-flow-template-resolution-install`

**Actor**: `cpt-frontx-actor-project-developer`

**Success Scenarios**:
- Developer installs a template from a remote source-spec and it is added to the local inventory at the exact immutable commit or package version the fetch settled on
- Developer installs a template from a local `path:<relative-path>` origin naming a folder inside the project's own tree, and it is added to the local inventory as given, with no pin fabricated (`target`)

**Error Scenarios**:
- Source registry is unreachable; install fails with `ORIGIN_UNAVAILABLE` before any inventory write
- Source-spec is missing the `host:` prefix or the `@ref` selector, or carries a malformed subtree segment; rejected with `INVALID_INPUT` before any fetch
- The referenced subtree holds no content at the referenced version; install fails with `ORIGIN_UNAVAILABLE` before any inventory write
- The fetched template declares an identity the local inventory already tracks for a different template address; install is rejected with `REGISTRATION_CONFLICT` before any inventory write. A reference differing only in its version selector names the same template and is not a collision
- The fetched template declares an identity that nests with an already-installed identity, one being a leading path segment sequence of the other; install is rejected with `REGISTRATION_CONFLICT` before any inventory write, because the two are two inventory keys but not two directories
- A `path:<relative-path>` origin cannot be proven to resolve inside the project root, or names a path that does not exist; install is rejected with `INVALID_PATH` before any inventory write (`target`)

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Developer invokes the CLI install command with a versioned source-spec (`host:owner/repo[//subtree]@ref`) or a local `path:<relative-path>` origin - `inst-install-invoke`
2. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the origin is a remote source-spec, CLI forwards the string to the source-spec parser - `inst-install-parse`
3. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the parser returns a parse error (missing `host:` prefix, missing `@ref` selector, or a malformed repository path or subtree segment): - `inst-install-parse-check`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `INVALID_INPUT`; abort install with no inventory write - `inst-install-parse-reject`
4. [x] - `p1` - CLI forwards the parsed structured reference, or the local `path:` origin unparsed, to the shared resolver (`cpt-frontx-algo-template-resolution-resolve-to-inventory`) - `inst-install-resolve`
5. [x] - `p1` - For a remote origin, the shared resolver attempts to fetch template content from the source registry (`cpt-frontx-actor-github`) at the resolved ref; for a local origin, it reads the named folder's current content directly - `inst-install-fetch`
6. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the source registry is unreachable or returns an error, or a local path cannot be proven to stay inside the project root: - `inst-install-reach-check`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `ORIGIN_UNAVAILABLE` for an unreachable registry, or `INVALID_PATH` for a local path that cannot be proven to stay inside the project root; abort install with no inventory write - `inst-install-reach-fail`
7. [x] - `p1` - CLI materializes the resolved content into the tracked local inventory under the identity the manifest declares, with the remote fetch's immutable pin or the local path recorded as given - `inst-install-materialize`
8. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** install success with the installed identity and resolved version/origin to developer - `inst-install-success`

### List Local Template Inventory

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-flow-template-resolution-list`

**Actor**: `cpt-frontx-actor-project-developer`

**Success Scenarios**:
- Developer sees the platform's default templates, the current project's registered templates, and the templates installed locally but not yet registered, each with its version
- Caller requests the machine-readable form and receives the uniform envelope's `data` carrying all three sets side by side, each entry with the description its manifest declares - the catalog a program reads to compose an explicit batch without parsing prose or reading inventory storage directly

**Error Scenarios**:
- All three sets are empty; CLI reports the empty state with no error, as the empty message in the human form and as three empty collections in the machine-readable form
- The invocation carries an argument that is not the recognized machine-readable flag: the command is refused with `INVALID_INPUT` and a usage line naming the unrecognized argument, and neither listing form is emitted. A near-miss flag must not fall through to the human form, because a calling program would then receive a success exit code alongside output it cannot parse - a silently wrong answer where a refusal it can act on was available. Repeating the recognized flag is not an error: it names the same form unambiguously.
- The current project's `.frontx/project.json` exists but does not satisfy the project-state contract: the machine-readable form emits `{"ok": false, "error": {"code": "PROJECT_INVALID", ...}}` (`cpt-frontx-adr-uniform-cli-json-envelope`) rather than a partial or silently-empty `registered` set.

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Developer or calling program invokes the CLI list command, optionally requesting the machine-readable form - `inst-list-invoke`
2. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the invocation carries any argument that is not the recognized machine-readable flag - `inst-list-check-args`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `INVALID_INPUT`, naming the unrecognized argument(s) and the accepted usage form; no listing is emitted in either form - `inst-list-abort-unknown-arg`
3. [x] - `p1` - CLI reads the platform's default templates, the tracked local inventory, and, when a `.frontx/project.json` is present, the current project's `templates` map (`target`) - `inst-list-read`
4. [x] - `p1` - **IF** a present `.frontx/project.json` does not satisfy the project-state contract (`target`) - `inst-list-project-invalid-check`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN**, in the machine-readable form, `{"ok": false, "error": {"code": "PROJECT_INVALID", ...}}` (`cpt-frontx-adr-uniform-cli-json-envelope`); the human-readable form reports the same failure as text (`target`) - `inst-list-project-invalid-return`
5. [x] - `p1` - **IF** all three sets contain no entries: - `inst-list-empty-check`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** empty message to developer, or three empty collections when the machine-readable form was requested - `inst-list-empty-return`
6. [x] - `p1` - CLI formats each set's entries as name and version for the human-readable form - `inst-list-format`
7. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the machine-readable form was requested, CLI instead emits the uniform envelope's `{"ok": true, "data": {...}}` with `data.defaults`, `data.registered`, and `data.installed` populated per `1.5 Machine-Readable Catalog Envelope` - omitting `description` for a legacy-installed entry whose manifest predates the required-description contract and declares none, rather than substituting a placeholder a caller could mistake for a declaration (`target`) - `inst-list-format-machine`
8. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** formatted listing, or the emitted envelope, to developer - `inst-list-return`

### Update Installed Template in Local Inventory

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-flow-template-resolution-update-local`

**Actor**: `cpt-frontx-actor-project-developer`

**Success Scenarios**:
- Developer updates a specific inventory entry to a newer version; no scaffolded project path is modified

**Error Scenarios**:
- Named template is not found in local inventory; CLI reports `TEMPLATE_NOT_REGISTERED` and makes no changes
- Source registry is unreachable; CLI reports `ORIGIN_UNAVAILABLE` and leaves the existing inventory entry unchanged
- The new source-spec resolves to a template declaring a different identity; CLI reports `REGISTRATION_CONFLICT` and leaves the existing inventory entry unchanged rather than substituting one template for another

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Developer invokes the CLI update-local command with the template name and a new versioned source-spec - `inst-update-invoke`
2. [x] - `p1` - CLI looks up the named entry in the tracked local inventory index - `inst-update-lookup`
3. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the named entry is absent from the local inventory: - `inst-update-notfound-check`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `TEMPLATE_NOT_REGISTERED`; abort update with no inventory write - `inst-update-notfound`
4. [x] - `p1` - CLI forwards the new source-spec to the source-spec parser - `inst-update-parse`
5. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the parser returns a parse error: - `inst-update-parse-check`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `INVALID_INPUT`; abort update with no inventory write - `inst-update-parse-reject`
6. [x] - `p1` - CLI forwards the parsed reference to the shared resolver and fetches the updated content from the source registry - `inst-update-fetch`
7. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the source registry is unreachable or returns an error: - `inst-update-reach-check`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `ORIGIN_UNAVAILABLE`; leave the existing inventory entry unchanged - `inst-update-reach-fail`
8. [x] - `p1` - CLI replaces the inventory store entry for the named template with the fetched content at the new pinned version - `inst-update-write`
9. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** update success with the template name and new pinned version to developer - `inst-update-success`

## 3. Processes / Business Logic (CDSL)

Internal system functions and procedures that do not interact with actors directly. These are reusable building blocks called by Actor Flows or other processes.

### Source-Spec Parse and Validate

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-algo-template-resolution-parse-spec`

**Input**: A raw source-spec string supplied by the developer

**Output**: A structured reference (host, owner, repo, optional subtree, ref) or `INVALID_INPUT`

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Check that the input string contains a `:` separator - `inst-parse-prefix-check`
2. [x] - `p1` - **IF** no `:` separator is present: - `inst-parse-no-prefix`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `INVALID_INPUT`: missing `host:` prefix; acquisition cannot proceed without an explicit host - `inst-parse-no-prefix-fail`
3. [x] - `p1` - Extract the host token as the substring before the first `:` - `inst-parse-extract-host`
4. [x] - `p1` - Check that the remainder after `:` contains an `@` separator - `inst-parse-at-check`
5. [x] - `p1` - **IF** no `@` separator is present: - `inst-parse-no-at`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `INVALID_INPUT`: missing `@ref` version selector; acquisition cannot proceed without an explicit version pin - `inst-parse-no-at-fail`
6. [x] - `p1` - Extract the repository path as the substring between `:` and `@` - `inst-parse-extract-repo`
7. [x] - `p1` - Split the repository path on its first `//` separator into an `owner/repo` part and an optional subtree part - `inst-parse-extract-subtree`
8. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the `owner/repo` part is not exactly one owner segment followed by one repository segment, or a subtree separator is present with a subtree part that is empty, absolute, or carries an empty, `.`, or `..` segment: - `inst-parse-invalid-path`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `INVALID_INPUT`: malformed repository path or subtree segment; acquisition cannot proceed without an unambiguous repository and subtree - `inst-parse-invalid-path-fail`
9. [x] - `p1` - Extract the ref selector as the substring after `@` - `inst-parse-extract-ref`
10. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** structured reference containing host, owner, repo, the subtree when present, and ref - `inst-parse-return`

### Resolve Source-Spec to Tracked Local Inventory

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-algo-template-resolution-resolve-to-inventory`

**Input**: Either a validated structured reference (host, owner, repo, optional subtree, ref) for a remote origin, or a local `path:<relative-path>` origin naming a folder inside the project's own tree

**Output**: A materialized inventory entry (identity, installed content path addressing the template's actual on-disk files, resolved version, and — for a remote origin — the pinned immutable origin the fetch settled on) or a resolution failure (`INVALID_PATH`, `ORIGIN_UNAVAILABLE`, `INVALID_MANIFEST`, or `REGISTRATION_CONFLICT`)

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the input is a local `path:<relative-path>` origin rather than a remote structured reference: - `inst-resolve-origin-kind-check`
   1. [x] - `p1` - Canonicalize the path and confirm it resolves inside the project root under the same fail-closed check applied to every other CLI-checked path (`cpt-frontx-adr-nesting-aware-conflict-prevention`); a path a symlink or a `..` segment could carry outside the root, or that does not exist, is refused - `inst-resolve-local-path-check`
   2. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the path cannot be proven to stay inside the project root, or does not exist: - `inst-resolve-local-path-fail-check`
      1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `INVALID_PATH` naming the path; do not write to local inventory - `inst-resolve-local-path-fail`
   3. [x] - `p1` - Read the folder's current content directly as the acquired content, and record the path exactly as given as the origin — **not pinned**, because a local origin has no separate publication to resolve to an immutable form (`cpt-frontx-adr-template-registration-and-origin-pinning`) - `inst-resolve-local-path-read`
   4. [x] - `p1` - Proceed to manifest identity resolution (step 6) with this acquired content and this unpinned origin - `inst-resolve-local-path-continue`
2. [x] - `p1` - **ELSE** (a remote structured reference): construct the fetch address for the source registry (`cpt-frontx-actor-github`) from the structured reference, and the re-resolvable source-spec string that reproduces it — including its subtree when the reference carries one, so a later re-resolution addresses the same template rather than the repository root - `inst-resolve-addr`
3. [x] - `p1` - Fetch the template content from the source registry at the given ref - `inst-resolve-fetch`
4. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the fetch fails: - `inst-resolve-fetch-fail-check`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `ORIGIN_UNAVAILABLE`; do not write to local inventory - `inst-resolve-fetch-fail`
5. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the reference carries a subtree, narrow the acquired content to that subtree and re-root every retained path so it is relative to the subtree rather than to the repository - `inst-resolve-subtree`
6. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the acquired content is not a multi-file bundle, the referenced subtree holds no content at the referenced version, or narrowing would re-root a retained path outside the subtree: - `inst-resolve-subtree-empty`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `ORIGIN_UNAVAILABLE` when the subtree holds no content, or `INVALID_PATH` when a retained path would re-root outside the subtree, naming the subtree and, where a path is at fault, that path; do not write to local inventory - `inst-resolve-subtree-empty-fail`
7. [x] - `p1` - Settle the fetch's exact immutable commit SHA or exact package version as the pinned origin — never the typed, possibly-moving `@ref` — the value `register` later writes into `templates[name].origin` (`cpt-frontx-adr-template-registration-and-origin-pinning`) - `inst-resolve-pin`
8. [x] - `p1` - Read the template's manifest from the acquired content and take the identity it declares as the template's identity - `inst-resolve-name`
9. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the manifest is absent, unreadable, or declares an identity that is empty or not usable as an installed content path — an identity must be relative and free of empty, `.` and `..` segments, while a scoped identity carrying a `/` remains admissible - `inst-resolve-identity-missing`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `INVALID_MANIFEST`; do not write to local inventory - `inst-resolve-identity-missing-fail`
10. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the local inventory already tracks that identity for a different template address — the reference with its version selector removed, so that a reference differing only in version names the same template rather than a colliding one — **OR** the declared identity nests with an identity the inventory already tracks, one being a leading path segment sequence of the other, because two nesting identities are two inventory keys but not two directories and a bounded update of the outer one clears the inner one from disk while leaving it indexed: - `inst-resolve-collision-check`
    1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `REGISTRATION_CONFLICT` naming the occupying identity together with the requested one, and for an address collision both sources; do not write to local inventory and do not merge into or nest beneath the occupant's content path - `inst-resolve-collision-fail`
11. [x] - `p1` - Materialize the acquired template content — the template's actual files together with its manifest — on disk in the local inventory store under the declared identity, addressable at an installed content path - `inst-resolve-write`
12. [x] - `p1` - Record the installed identity, and either the pinned origin (remote) or the literal path (local), in the inventory index - `inst-resolve-index`
13. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** inventory entry containing identity, installed content path, and resolved version/origin - `inst-resolve-return`

Note on identity: the identity this algorithm reads from the manifest (`name`) is what keys this local inventory and, once `register` runs, what keys a project's `.frontx/project.json` `templates` map (`cpt-frontx-adr-template-registration-and-origin-pinning`). It is a template's registration identity, not the identity of any one applied instance — an applied instance's identity is its unique `target` (`cpt-frontx-adr-explicit-batch-application`), never a second `instanceId` or `registryPath`; see the note under "Template Identity Comes From the Manifest and Collisions Are Rejected" (§5) for the full distinction.

### Bounded Local Inventory Update

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-algo-template-resolution-bounded-update`

**Input**: Template name and a validated structured reference for the new version

**Output**: An updated inventory entry (name, new pinned version) or a failure (`TEMPLATE_NOT_REGISTERED`, `ORIGIN_UNAVAILABLE`, `REGISTRATION_CONFLICT`); scaffolded projects are not touched

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Look up the named entry in the inventory index - `inst-bupd-lookup`
2. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the named entry is absent: - `inst-bupd-absent-check`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `TEMPLATE_NOT_REGISTERED`; abort with no inventory write - `inst-bupd-absent-fail`
3. [x] - `p1` - Fetch the new template content from the source registry at the new ref using the shared resolver - `inst-bupd-fetch`
4. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the fetch fails: - `inst-bupd-fetch-fail-check`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `ORIGIN_UNAVAILABLE`; leave the existing inventory entry unchanged - `inst-bupd-fetch-fail`
5. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the newly fetched content declares an identity other than the entry being updated: - `inst-bupd-identity-mismatch`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `REGISTRATION_CONFLICT` naming both the entry's identity and the declared one; leave the existing inventory entry unchanged, since replacing it would substitute one template for another under the entry's identity - `inst-bupd-identity-mismatch-fail`
6. [x] - `p1` - Replace the named template's materialized files in the inventory store with the newly fetched content at its installed content path - `inst-bupd-replace`
7. [x] - `p1` - Update the inventory index to record the new pinned ref for the named entry - `inst-bupd-index-update`
8. [x] - `p1` - Confirm that no paths outside the local inventory store were written during this operation - `inst-bupd-boundary-confirm`
9. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** updated inventory entry containing name and new pinned version - `inst-bupd-return`

This bounded update re-fetches a *remote* origin's inventory entry to a new ref; it does not apply to an entry installed from a local `path:` origin, which has no separate pinned copy to bound-update in the first place — the resolver reads that folder's current content at every resolution (`inst-resolve-local-path-read`), so the folder's own content is already "current" without a bound-update step, and a change reaching an already-applied target still happens only through the explicit `upgrade` path, never a local re-fetch (`cpt-frontx-adr-template-registration-and-origin-pinning`).

## 4. States (CDSL)

### Inventory Template State Machine

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-state-template-resolution-inventory-lifecycle`

**States**: UNRESOLVED, RESOLVED, INSTALLED, UPDATED

**Initial State**: UNRESOLVED

**Transitions**:
1. [x] - `p1` - **FROM** UNRESOLVED **TO** RESOLVED **WHEN** the source-spec is successfully parsed and the source registry returns the template content for the given ref - `inst-state-to-resolved`
2. [x] - `p1` - **FROM** RESOLVED **TO** INSTALLED **WHEN** the fetched content is materialized into the local inventory store and the inventory index is updated with the pinned version - `inst-state-to-installed`
3. [x] - `p1` - **FROM** INSTALLED **TO** UPDATED **WHEN** a bounded local update fetches new content for the named inventory entry, replaces it in the inventory store, and updates the index without touching any scaffolded project - `inst-state-to-updated`
4. [x] - `p1` - **FROM** UNRESOLVED **TO** UNRESOLVED **WHEN** source-spec parse validation fails (missing `host:` prefix, missing `@ref` selector, or a malformed repository path or subtree segment) and the inventory is not written - `inst-state-parse-fail-loop`
5. [x] - `p1` - **FROM** RESOLVED **TO** UNRESOLVED **WHEN** the source registry fetch fails after a successful parse and the inventory is not written - `inst-state-fetch-fail-loop`
6. [x] - `p1` - **FROM** RESOLVED **TO** UNRESOLVED **WHEN** the referenced subtree holds no content, the acquired content declares no usable identity, or the declared identity is already tracked for a different source-spec, and the inventory is not written - `inst-state-reject-loop`

Specific implementation tasks derived from flows/algorithms above.

### CLI Installs Template by Versioned Source-Spec

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dod-template-resolution-install-by-spec`

The system **MUST** install a template into the local inventory by resolving a developer-supplied `host:owner/repo[//subtree]@ref` source-spec, or a local `path:<relative-path>` origin naming a folder inside the project's own tree, through the shared resolver, materialize the resolved content as the template's actual on-disk files in the tracked inventory store addressable at an installed content path (not a single manifest blob), and record the resolved version — with zero template content bundled in the CLI distribution. When the source-spec carries a subtree segment, the system **MUST** materialize only that subtree, re-rooted so every materialized path is relative to the subtree rather than to the repository, and **MUST** retain the subtree in the re-resolvable source-spec it records. For a remote source-spec, the system **MUST** record the origin as the exact immutable commit SHA or exact package version the fetch settled on, never the typed, possibly-moving `@ref` (`cpt-frontx-adr-template-registration-and-origin-pinning`); for a `path:` origin, which has no separate publication to pin against, the system **MUST** record the path exactly as given and **MUST NOT** fabricate a pin. The system **MUST** refuse with `INVALID_INPUT` a malformed source-spec, `INVALID_PATH` a local origin that cannot be proven to stay inside the project root or a subtree re-rooting escape, `ORIGIN_UNAVAILABLE` an unreachable registry or an empty referenced subtree, `INVALID_MANIFEST` unreadable or unusable acquired content, and `REGISTRATION_CONFLICT` a declared identity already tracked or nesting with one the inventory already tracks (`target`).

**Constraints**: `cpt-frontx-constraint-cli-template-independence`

**Touches**:
- Entities: `Template`

### CLI Lists Local Template Inventory

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dod-template-resolution-list-inventory`

The system **MUST** report, when the developer invokes the list command, the platform's default templates — drawn from the CLI's own built-in list of official default origins (`cpt-frontx-feature-cli-scaffolding`'s `seed`; `cpt-frontx-adr-template-registration-and-origin-pinning`, "Catalog visibility"), never from a `.frontx/project.json` or a third-party source — the current project's registered templates, and the templates installed locally but not yet registered, each with its version, and **MUST** additionally offer a machine-readable form carrying all three sets inside the one uniform envelope every command's `--json` mode emits (`{"ok": true, "data": {...}}` / `{"ok": false, "error": {...}}`, `cpt-frontx-adr-uniform-cli-json-envelope`) - the surface over which a calling program obtains the selectable set without reading the inventory's storage or the project state document directly. Each entry in every set carries the description its manifest declares; the key is omitted, never reported as empty or a placeholder, only for a legacy-installed entry whose manifest predates the required-description contract and so declares none — a conforming entry under the current contract always carries one. A `.frontx/project.json` that fails the project-state contract is reported as `{"ok": false, "error": {"code": "PROJECT_INVALID", ...}}` rather than a partial `registered` set; and the command **MUST** refuse an invocation carrying any argument that is not the recognized machine-readable flag with `INVALID_INPUT` rather than falling through to either listing form (`target` for the machine-readable form and for the argument refusal).

**Implements**:
- `cpt-frontx-flow-template-resolution-list`

**Constraints**: `cpt-frontx-constraint-cli-template-independence`

**Touches**:
- Entities: `Template`
- CLI: list command, machine-readable output form (`target`)

### CLI Updates Local Inventory Entry Without Touching Scaffolded Projects

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dod-template-resolution-bounded-local-update`

The system **MUST** replace a named inventory entry with the newly fetched content at the new pinned version, writing exclusively within the local inventory store and leaving every scaffolded project path unchanged, refusing with `TEMPLATE_NOT_REGISTERED` when the name is absent from the inventory, `ORIGIN_UNAVAILABLE` when the fetch fails, and `REGISTRATION_CONFLICT` when the fetched content declares a different identity.

- `cpt-frontx-algo-template-resolution-bounded-update`

**Constraints**: `cpt-frontx-constraint-cli-template-independence`

**Touches**:
- Entities: `Template`

### Source-Spec Parser Rejects Invalid References

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dod-template-resolution-spec-parser-rejection`

The system **MUST** reject with `INVALID_INPUT` any source-spec that omits the `host:` prefix or the `@ref` version selector before any fetch or inventory write is attempted, **MUST** likewise reject rather than reinterpret a repository path whose segment count is not two, an empty or trailing-slash subtree segment, and a subtree segment carrying an empty, `.`, or `..` segment, **MUST** round-trip a valid `host:owner/repo//subtree@ref` reference into its five constituent parts (host, owner, repo, subtree, ref), and **MUST** parse a reference without the subtree segment into the same four parts as before, carrying no subtree.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-frontx-algo-template-resolution-parse-spec`

**Constraints**: `cpt-frontx-constraint-cli-template-independence`

**Touches**:
- Entities: `Template`

### Template Identity Comes From the Manifest and Collisions Are Rejected

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dod-template-resolution-manifest-identity`

The system **MUST** take a template's identity from the identity its own manifest declares rather than from the repository the reference names, and **MUST** use that identity as the inventory index key, as the installed content path, and as the identity recorded for the template. The system **MUST** reject with `INVALID_MANIFEST` a reference whose acquired content carries no readable manifest or declares an identity that is empty or not usable as an installed content path — relative, free of empty, `.` and `..` segments, with a scoped identity carrying a `/` remaining admissible — and **MUST** reject with `REGISTRATION_CONFLICT` an install whose declared identity is already tracked for a different template address — naming both the occupying source and the requested one — rather than writing into the occupant's content path, while admitting a reference that differs only in its version selector, which names the same template at another version. The system **MUST** likewise reject with `REGISTRATION_CONFLICT` an install whose declared identity nests with an identity the inventory already tracks, one being a leading path segment sequence of the other, naming the occupying identity: two nesting identities are two inventory keys but not two directories, so a bounded update of the outer one clears the inner one from disk while leaving it indexed.

**Two different uses of "identity" — not to be conflated.** The manifest-declared `name` this DoD fixes is a template's *registration identity*: it keys this local inventory, and, unchanged, it keys a project's `.frontx/project.json` `templates` map once `register` runs (`cpt-frontx-adr-template-registration-and-origin-pinning`) — one name maps to exactly one origin, never a caller-chosen alias. This is a distinct question from the identity of an *applied instance* of that template: once a template is applied, what distinguishes one applied instance from another is its unique `target`, not the template's registration identity — a `templates[name].targets` array can hold many targets under the one registered name, and there is no separate `instanceId` or `registryPath` naming an instance (`cpt-frontx-adr-explicit-batch-application`). A collision this DoD rejects is always a registration-identity collision inside the local inventory or the `templates` map; it is never a check over applied targets, which is the conflict checker's separate, target-keyed geometry (`cpt-frontx-adr-nesting-aware-conflict-prevention`).

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CLI install command resolves a valid `host:owner/repo@ref` source-spec, fetches from the source registry, and writes the result to the local inventory at the exact immutable commit or package version the fetch settled on, never the typed `@ref`
- [x] CLI install command resolves a local `path:<relative-path>` origin by reading the named folder's current content directly, records the path exactly as given with no pin fabricated, and refuses a path that cannot be proven to stay inside the project root (`target`)
- [ ] CLI install command with a source-spec missing the `host:` prefix or the `@ref` selector fails with `INVALID_INPUT` before any fetch or inventory write
- [ ] CLI install command resolves a valid `host:owner/repo//subtree@ref` source-spec and materializes only that subtree, with every materialized path relative to the subtree rather than to the repository
- [ ] A source-spec whose repository path does not consist of exactly one owner segment and one repository segment, or whose subtree segment is empty, trailing-slash, or carries an empty, `.`, or `..` segment, fails with `INVALID_INPUT` before any fetch or inventory write
- [ ] A source-spec naming a subtree that holds no content at the referenced version fails with `ORIGIN_UNAVAILABLE` identifying the subtree, and nothing is written to the local inventory
- [ ] A subtree whose acquired content carries a path that escapes the subtree once re-rooted is refused with `INVALID_PATH`, and nothing is written to the local inventory
- [ ] The identity a template is tracked under is the identity its manifest declares, and it is the inventory index key, the installed content path segment, and the identity recorded in the re-resolvable source-spec's provenance
- [ ] Two source-specs differing only in their subtree segment, whose manifests declare different identities, install as two distinct templates from one repository at one version, each at its own installed content path; if the two declare one identity the second install is refused with `REGISTRATION_CONFLICT`
- [ ] Installing a template whose declared identity is already tracked for a different source-spec fails with `REGISTRATION_CONFLICT` naming both sources, and the occupying template's content path is left unmodified
- [ ] Installing a template whose declared identity nests with an already-installed identity, such as `@acme/tools/extra` against an installed `@acme/tools`, fails with `REGISTRATION_CONFLICT` naming the occupying identity, and nothing is written under the occupant's content path
- [ ] CLI list command returns all installed templates and their pinned versions from the local inventory
- [x] CLI list command reports the platform's default templates, the current project's registered templates, and the templates installed locally but not yet registered, as three distinct sets (`target`)
- [ ] CLI list command reports an empty inventory when no templates are installed
- [x] CLI list command's machine-readable form emits the uniform envelope's `{"ok": true, "data": {defaults, registered, installed}}`, each set carrying every entry's name, version, and manifest-declared description (plus `origin` and, for `registered`, `targets`), with an empty set reported as `[]` and no `description` key for an entry whose manifest declares none — possible only for a legacy-installed entry, never for one conforming to the current required-description contract (`target`)
- [x] CLI list command refuses an unrecognized argument with `INVALID_INPUT` and a usage line naming it, emitting neither listing form, while a repeated recognized flag is accepted (`target`)
- [x] A `.frontx/project.json` that fails the project-state contract is reported as `{"ok": false, "error": {"code": "PROJECT_INVALID", ...}}` rather than a partial or silently-empty `registered` set (`target`)
- [ ] The `defaults` set reported by `list` (human-readable or `--json`) is sourced from the CLI's own built-in list of official default origins, independent of any project's `.frontx/project.json`.
- [ ] CLI update-local command replaces the named inventory entry with newly fetched content at the new pinned version, leaving every scaffolded project path unmodified
- [ ] CLI update-local command reports `TEMPLATE_NOT_REGISTERED` when the named template is absent from the local inventory
- [ ] No template content is bundled in the CLI distribution (zero template assets or dependencies in the CLI package)
- [ ] Inventory template state machine cycles UNRESOLVED → RESOLVED → INSTALLED → UPDATED under successful install and update flows
- [ ] Every `RETURN`-level refusal in this feature's flows and algorithms names a code from the shared error-code vocabulary (`cpt-frontx-adr-uniform-cli-json-envelope`).
