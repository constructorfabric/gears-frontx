## 1. Feature Context

- [x] `p2` - `cpt-frontx-feature-upgrade-changeset`

### 1.1 Overview

The Upgrade Change-Set Engine is the single `target` CLI-owned mechanism (`cpt-frontx-component-cli-change-set-engine`) that upgrades a registered template's **name** — every target that name has been applied to, atomically, as one unit. `upgrade <templateName> <new-origin>` reads the name's current `{origin, version}` entry from `cpt-frontx-feature-composed-provenance`'s single project state document as its only baseline, resolves the new origin through the shared resolver, classifies every file inside every target listed under the name into a typed whole-file operation, presents the resulting operation plan for developer review, and — only on approval — commits the new `origin`/`version` (and the name's immediately preceding `{origin, version}`) atomically to the project state store while landing the plan within each target's effective ownership. A partial upgrade, where one target of a name moves to the new version while a sibling target of the same name stays on the old one, is not a representable state: the registry records exactly one `origin` and one `version` per name. All CDSL behavior is `target` (GREENFIELD — grounded in `cpt-frontx-adr-project-upgrade-mechanism`, `cpt-frontx-adr-project-provenance-record`, and DESIGN §3.2/§3.6).

The unit of operation is the template **name**, not one applied instance, and the baseline is the single registry entry that name carries: the registry records one `origin`/`version` pair per name, covering every target that name has been applied to. There is no per-instance provenance record to diff against, and none is retained for the purpose. The feature's identifier, `cpt-frontx-feature-upgrade-changeset`, covers the per-target, per-file change set of typed whole-file operations — `ADD`, `REPLACE`, `REMOVE`, `KEEP_LOCAL`, `UNCHANGED` — computed once for the whole name by a three-way classification against the baseline the registry entry re-resolves, carried as data in the CLI's single JSON result envelope, applied through a staged write that never rewrites a file the developer has changed, and reversed by the same engine one generation back. A doubly-changed file — one the candidate and the on-disk content have each moved away from the baseline — is refused whole, with `CONTENT_CONFLICT`, never merged or partially rewritten.

### 1.2 Purpose

This feature exists to let a project developer safely adopt a newer origin for any registered template, across every target it has been applied to, without hand-editing files or risking an unreviewed or partially-applied change. It satisfies `cpt-frontx-fr-cli-project-upgrade-changeset` (the upgrade is one atomic change set covering all of a name's targets), `cpt-frontx-fr-cli-upgrade-review-approval` (no file is written until the developer approves), and `cpt-frontx-fr-cli-upgrade-restore` (an approved upgrade remains reversible). The engine is reusable across invokers — direct CLI use and AI-driven orchestration (`cpt-frontx-feature-ai-upgrade-orchestration`) both drive the same engine, never a second implementation.

`cpt-frontx-adr-project-upgrade-mechanism` fixes the unit of upgrade (a template name, atomically across all its targets), the source of its baseline (the project state store's `origin`/`version` entry, forward and preceding alike), the changeset representation, the three-way whole-file classification that computes it, the staged write and failure recovery that apply it, and the one-generation reversal that undoes it. This feature's validation and commit algorithms carry out that mechanism directly: validation classifies every file inside the candidate's effective ownership against the baseline and the candidate and refuses the whole upgrade with `CONTENT_CONFLICT` on any doubly-changed file, or with `TARGET_CONFLICT` where the candidate newly claims ground another registered template's target nests inside; commit lands the classified plan through a staged write and, on success, records the one preceding `{origin, version}` the reversal needs. `cpt-frontx-fr-cli-upgrade-restore`'s reversibility requirement is carried out by the identical engine run in the other direction (see §5, "Restore to Pre-Upgrade State").

**Requirements**: `cpt-frontx-fr-cli-project-upgrade-changeset`, `cpt-frontx-fr-cli-upgrade-review-approval`, `cpt-frontx-fr-cli-upgrade-restore`

**Principles**: `cpt-frontx-cli-principle-reviewed-reversible-mutation`

**Applicability** (Often-N/A domains for a CLI Command feature, per the FEATURE checklist's Applicability Context): SEC and COMPL are not applicable — this engine enforces no authentication or authorization boundary and carries no regulatory scope; the closest security-adjacent control is `REGISTRATION_CONFLICT` on an identity mismatch (`inst-val-if-identity-mismatch`), a supply-chain integrity check rather than an auth boundary. OPS (observability) is not applicable — no logging, metrics, or tracing surface is introduced beyond the reviewable transition this feature already presents. UX is addressed by the developer review-and-approval presentation (§2, "Developer Review and Approval of an Atomic All-Targets Upgrade"). PERF is addressed by `cpt-frontx-cli-nfr-template-scale` (§6, Acceptance Criteria).

- **Dependencies**:
  - `cpt-frontx-feature-composed-provenance` — owns the single project state document; this engine reads the name's `{origin, version, targets[]}` entry as its baseline and commits the post-upgrade `origin`/`version` back into it, but does not redefine the document or the contract.
  - `cpt-frontx-feature-template-resolution` — resolves the new origin through the same shared resolver every other lifecycle command uses.
  - `cpt-frontx-feature-cli-scaffolding` (F12 — the engine reuses `cpt-frontx-algo-cli-scaffolding-uniform-apply`'s six-term subtraction (`inst-ua-compute-ownership`) to compute a target's effective ownership from a manifest's `excludedSubtrees`, and `cpt-frontx-algo-cli-scaffolding-conflict-check`'s nesting-aware check to detect another registered template's target nested inside newly claimed ground, rather than redefining either; also owns the CLI-owned AI-extension bundle step (`cpt-frontx-algo-cli-scaffolding-ai-bundle`) this engine invokes to refresh a name's `.frontx/ai/<manifest-name>/` bundle on a committed upgrade, without redefining that step).

### Developer Review and Approval of an Atomic All-Targets Upgrade

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-flow-upgrade-changeset-review-approval`

**Actor**: `cpt-frontx-actor-project-developer`

**Realizes**: `cpt-frontx-cli-seq-upgrade-review-apply`

**Success Scenarios**:
- Developer approves the validated operation plan; the engine commits the new `origin`/`version` and the name's immediately preceding `{origin, version}` atomically across every target of the name, and lands every `ADD`/`REPLACE`/`REMOVE` operation within each target's candidate-manifest-bounded effective ownership, writing nothing to a `KEEP_LOCAL` or `UNCHANGED` path and nothing to a path reported `SKIPPED`.

**Error Scenarios**:
- The name has no entry in the project state store: `TEMPLATE_NOT_REGISTERED`.
- The name's `targets` array is empty: the engine refuses with `TARGET_NOT_APPLIED`, directing the developer to `register --replace` instead — there is no applied ground for `upgrade` to reconcile.
- The name's recorded `version` no longer matches what its recorded `origin` reports: the engine refuses with `VERSION_MISMATCH` before resolving the candidate origin, because the baseline it would diff against is not the state the project actually holds.
- The new origin cannot be resolved: `ORIGIN_UNAVAILABLE`; the engine reports the failure and aborts before writing anything.
- The new origin's manifest declares a `name` different from the registered name being upgraded: the engine refuses with `REGISTRATION_CONFLICT`, naming both identities, and computes no transition — a registered name's identity comes from exactly one place, its own manifest, and `upgrade` must not silently re-key an entry to a different template.
- A file inside any target's candidate-bounded effective ownership has both moved away from the baseline and does not already match the candidate: the engine refuses the entire upgrade with `CONTENT_CONFLICT`, naming every such target and path, and `templates[name]` is left unchanged for every target.
- Ground the candidate newly claims because it dropped an exclusion the baseline manifest declared nests another registered template's target: the engine refuses the entire upgrade with `TARGET_CONFLICT`, naming the contesting target and template, and `templates[name]` is left unchanged for every target.
- After approval, the commit algorithm can still refuse or fail: a pre-rename drift refusal (`CONTENT_CONFLICT`, no destination touched), a recovered I/O failure (`INTERNAL`, every target exactly as before), a failed recovery (`INTERNAL` naming both the original failure and every path it could not return, though one or more destinations may not be at their baseline state), a promotion failure after the commit point (`INTERNAL` naming the slot, with `templates[name].origin`/`.version` and its preceding pair standing committed regardless), or an AI-extension bundle refresh failure after promotion (`INTERNAL` naming the bundle, with the transition and the promoted inventory entry both standing).
- Developer declines the presented operation plan: no project files are written and `templates[name]` and the local inventory entry are left unchanged.

1. [x] - `p1` - Developer invokes `upgrade <templateName> <new-origin>` - `inst-invoke-upgrade`
2. [x] - `p1` - Engine reads `templates[templateName]` — its current `origin`, `version`, and `targets[]` — from the project state store (`cpt-frontx-feature-composed-provenance`) as its baseline - `inst-read-provenance`

[x] - `p1` - **RETURN** the corresponding failure (`ORIGIN_UNAVAILABLE`, `REGISTRATION_CONFLICT` for an identity mismatch, `CONTENT_CONFLICT` naming every doubly-changed target and path, or `TARGET_CONFLICT` naming the contesting target and template); `templates[templateName]` and the local inventory entry unchanged for every target - `inst-abort-no-target`
7. [x] - `p1` - Engine presents the validated operation plan — the current `{origin, version}`, the new `{origin, version}`, and, for every target in `targets[]`, the typed per-file operations (`ADD`, `REPLACE`, `REMOVE`, `KEEP_LOCAL`, `UNCHANGED`) the classification computed, together with every payload path reported `SKIPPED` because it falls outside the candidate-bounded effective ownership or because it collides with the reserved temporary-file naming convention — to the developer for review; the plan presented is the plan applied, without recomputation - `inst-present-changeset`

   5. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the commit reports a promotion failure - `inst-if-commit-promotion-failed`
      1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `INTERNAL` naming the slot it could not replace; `templates[templateName].origin`/`.version` and its preceding pair stand committed — the transition itself lands, only the inventory entry's promotion did not - `inst-return-commit-promotion-failed`
   6. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the commit reports an AI-extension bundle refresh failure - `inst-if-commit-bundle-refresh-failed`

### Developer Restores a Template's Pre-Upgrade State

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-flow-upgrade-changeset-restore`

**Actor**: `cpt-frontx-actor-project-developer`

**Use cases**: `cpt-frontx-usecase-upgrade-applied-template` (postcondition)

**Success Scenarios**:
- Developer requests restore via `frontx upgrade <templateName> --restore`; the engine runs the same classification, review, and staged write in the other direction — the name's recorded preceding pair as the candidate, the currently recorded entry as the baseline, the boundary computed from the preceding manifest — reverses `templates[name].origin`/`.version` and every target's applied content, within that boundary, back to the preceding state atomically across every target of the name, and records the origin it just left as the new preceding origin. A file the forward upgrade added into ground the current manifest had newly claimed lies outside the preceding manifest's boundary and stays exactly where it is, reported `SKIPPED` rather than reverted.

**Error Scenarios**:
- `templateName` has no entry in the project state store: the engine refuses with `TEMPLATE_NOT_REGISTERED`.
- `templateName`'s `targets[]` is empty: the engine refuses with `TARGET_NOT_APPLIED`, exactly as the forward direction does — there is no zero-target reversal that flips `origin`/`version` with no content moved.
- No `{origin, version}` is recorded as the name's preceding entry — the name has never been upgraded, or a later `register --replace` cleared the pair a prior upgrade or restore had recorded: the engine refuses with `NOTHING_TO_RESTORE`.
- The validation this flow invokes refuses: `VERSION_MISMATCH` when the currently recorded entry's own honesty check fails (the same check a forward upgrade's baseline gets) or when the recorded preceding origin resolves but reports a version different from the one recorded beside it; `ORIGIN_UNAVAILABLE` when the recorded preceding origin cannot be resolved at all; `REGISTRATION_CONFLICT` when the recorded preceding origin's manifest declares an identity different from `templateName`.
- A file inside any target's preceding-bounded effective ownership has both moved away from the current baseline and does not already match the preceding pair's content: the engine refuses the entire restore with `CONTENT_CONFLICT`, naming every such target and path, and `templates[name]` is left unchanged for every target.
- Ground the preceding manifest no longer excludes nests another registered template's target: the engine refuses the entire restore with `TARGET_CONFLICT`, naming the contesting target and template.
- After approval, the commit algorithm can still refuse or fail, exactly as a forward upgrade's can: a pre-rename drift refusal (`CONTENT_CONFLICT`, no destination touched), a recovered I/O failure (`INTERNAL`, every target exactly as before), a failed recovery (`INTERNAL` naming both the original failure and every path it could not return, though one or more destinations may not be at their baseline state), a promotion failure after the commit point (`INTERNAL` naming the slot, with `templates[name].origin`/`.version` and its new preceding pair standing committed regardless), or an AI-extension bundle refresh failure after promotion (`INTERNAL` naming the bundle, with the transition and the promoted inventory entry both standing).
- Developer declines the presented operation plan: no project files are written and `templates[name]` is left unchanged.

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Developer requests restore for `templateName` via `frontx upgrade <templateName> --restore` - `inst-rst-invoke`
2. [x] - `p1` - **IF** `templateName` has no entry - `inst-rst-if-not-registered`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `TEMPLATE_NOT_REGISTERED` - `inst-rst-return-not-registered`
3. [x] - `p1` - **IF** `templateName`'s `targets[]` is empty - `inst-rst-if-empty-targets`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `TARGET_NOT_APPLIED` - `inst-rst-return-empty-targets`
4. [x] - `p1` - **IF** no `{origin, version}` is recorded as `templateName`'s preceding entry - `inst-rst-if-unavailable`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `NOTHING_TO_RESTORE` - `inst-rst-return-unavailable`
5. [x] - `p1` - **ELSE** - `inst-rst-else`
   1. [x] - `p1` - Invoke the validation algorithm (`cpt-frontx-algo-upgrade-changeset-validate`) with `templateName`'s recorded preceding `{origin, version}` as the candidate — its recorded version supplied as the expected version checked against what it resolves to — and `templateName`'s currently recorded `{origin, version}` as the baseline; this is the validation algorithm's own single resolution of the preceding origin, never resolved separately beforehand - `inst-rst-invoke-validate`
   2. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the invoked validation reports a failure - `inst-rst-if-validate-fails`
      1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** the corresponding failure (`VERSION_MISMATCH` for either the current entry's own honesty or the preceding origin's recorded-version honesty, `ORIGIN_UNAVAILABLE`, `REGISTRATION_CONFLICT`, `CONTENT_CONFLICT` naming every doubly-changed target and path, or `TARGET_CONFLICT` naming the contesting target and template); `templates[templateName]` unchanged; no plan is presented - `inst-rst-return-validate-fail`
   3. [x] - `p1` - Present the resulting operation plan for review exactly as a forward upgrade does - `inst-rst-present`
   4. [x] - `p1` - **IF** developer approves - `inst-rst-if-approved`
      1. [x] - `p1` - Invoke the commit algorithm (`cpt-frontx-algo-upgrade-changeset-commit`) to land the reviewed plan within each target's effective ownership and to commit `templates[templateName].origin`/`.version` back to the preceding entry, atomically across every target, recording the origin the name is now leaving as its new preceding origin - `inst-rst-reverse-content`
      2. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the commit reports a pre-rename drift refusal - `inst-rst-if-commit-drift`
         1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `CONTENT_CONFLICT` naming every drifted destination; no destination was touched, and `templates[templateName]` is unchanged - `inst-rst-return-commit-drift`
      3. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the commit reports a recovered I/O failure - `inst-rst-if-commit-recovered`
         1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `INTERNAL` naming the original failure; every target and `templates[templateName]` are exactly as they were before the attempt - `inst-rst-return-commit-recovered`
      4. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the commit reports a failed recovery - `inst-rst-if-commit-recovery-failed`
         1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `INTERNAL` naming both the original failure and every path recovery could not return; `templates[templateName]` remains untouched, though one or more destination paths may not be at their baseline state - `inst-rst-return-commit-recovery-failed`
      5. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the commit reports a promotion failure - `inst-rst-if-commit-promotion-failed`
         1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `INTERNAL` naming the slot it could not replace; `templates[templateName].origin`/`.version` and its new preceding pair stand committed — the transition itself lands, only the inventory entry's promotion did not - `inst-rst-return-commit-promotion-failed`
      6. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the commit reports an AI-extension bundle refresh failure - `inst-rst-if-commit-bundle-refresh-failed`
         1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `INTERNAL` naming the bundle it could not refresh; `templates[templateName].origin`/`.version`, its new preceding pair, and the promoted inventory entry all stand committed — only the bundle refresh did not land - `inst-rst-return-commit-bundle-refresh-failed`
      7. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** success: the name and every one of its targets are at the preceding state within the preceding manifest's boundary, and the name's preceding entry now names the origin restore just left - `inst-rst-return-success`
   5. [x] - `p1` - **ELSE** (developer declines) - `inst-rst-else-declined`
      1. [x] - `p1` - Engine makes no changes to any project file, to `templates[templateName]`, or to the local inventory entry - `inst-rst-no-write-on-decline`
      2. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** declined - `inst-rst-return-declined`

## 3. Processes / Business Logic (CDSL)

### Validate a New Origin Against Every Target of a Name

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-algo-upgrade-changeset-validate`

**Input**: The registered name's current baseline `{origin, version, targets[]}`; a candidate `new-origin`; optionally, for a restore invocation only, the recorded expected version beside the candidate origin, checked against what the resolved candidate reports (a forward upgrade's candidate carries no such recorded expectation and never supplies this).

**Output**: A validated operation plan `{ from: {origin, version}, to: {origin, version}, targets[], operations[], skipped[] }` — `operations[]` a per-target, per-file list of `{ target, path, op }` where `op` is one of `ADD`, `REPLACE`, `REMOVE`, `KEEP_LOCAL`, `UNCHANGED`, and `skipped[]` a per-target, per-path list of payload paths left untouched because they fall outside the candidate-bounded effective ownership or because they collide with the reserved temporary-file naming convention — ready for review; or an idempotent no-op when the candidate resolves to the baseline's own `{origin, version}`; or a failure naming why validation did not pass (`VERSION_MISMATCH` for a baseline the project state misreports, or for a candidate carrying a recorded expected version that no longer matches what it resolves to, `ORIGIN_UNAVAILABLE` for an unresolvable origin, `REGISTRATION_CONFLICT` for a declared-identity mismatch, `CONTENT_CONFLICT` naming every target and path where a file has both moved away from the baseline and does not already match the candidate, or `TARGET_CONFLICT` naming every target and template where the candidate newly claims ground another registered template's target nests inside).

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Confirm the recorded baseline is still honest before anything is computed from it, and obtain the baseline payload and the baseline manifest's declared `excludedSubtrees` classification will compare against: resolve the name's currently recorded `origin` and compare the version it reports against the `version` recorded beside it in the project state document - `inst-val-check-baseline`
2. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the recorded `version` differs from the version the recorded origin now reports - `inst-val-if-baseline-drift`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `VERSION_MISMATCH` naming the template name, its recorded version, and the version its recorded origin now reports; no transition is computed and no target is inspected, because a transition computed from a baseline the project state misreports would diff against a version this project never actually had. For a pinned remote origin this can only mean `.frontx/project.json` was hand-edited or corrupted, since an immutable pin re-fetches identically (`cpt-frontx-adr-source-spec-syntax`); for a `path:` origin it is genuine drift in the local folder, which has no publication to pin against — the same two cases `cpt-frontx-feature-composed-provenance`'s `validate --project` distinguishes for this code - `inst-val-return-baseline-drift`
3. [x] - `p1` - Resolve `new-origin` through the shared resolver (`cpt-frontx-feature-template-resolution`), pinning it exactly as `register` would; this resolution pins the candidate and makes its content addressable without replacing the registered name's own entry in the local template inventory, which keeps holding the baseline's content throughout — this is the only resolution of `new-origin` this algorithm performs, and a caller (including restore) never re-resolves it beforehand - `inst-val-resolve-new-origin`
4. [x] - `p1` - **IF** resolution fails - `inst-val-if-resolve-fail`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `ORIGIN_UNAVAILABLE` - `inst-val-return-unavailable`
5. [x] - `p1` - **IF** a recorded expected version was supplied for the candidate and the resolved candidate now reports a different version - `inst-val-if-candidate-version-mismatch`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `VERSION_MISMATCH` naming the name, the recorded expected version, and the version now reported; no target is inspected — the same baseline-honesty semantics this algorithm already applies to the baseline, applied here to a candidate that itself carries a recorded expectation, which is what a restore's preceding pair is - `inst-val-return-candidate-version-mismatch`
6. [x] - `p1` - Read the resolved manifest's declared `name` and its declared `excludedSubtrees` - `inst-val-read-name`
7. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the resolved `name` differs from the registered name being upgraded - `inst-val-if-identity-mismatch`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `REGISTRATION_CONFLICT` naming both identities; no target is inspected - `inst-val-return-identity-mismatch`
8. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the resolved candidate's `{origin, version}` equals the baseline's currently recorded `{origin, version}` - `inst-val-if-candidate-is-baseline`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** an idempotent no-op: no operation plan is computed, nothing is written, and the name's preceding pair is left exactly as it is — an upgrade to where the name already is does not consume the one generation of reversal - `inst-val-return-noop`
9. [x] - `p1` - **FOR EACH** target in `targets[]` - `inst-val-foreach-target`
   1. [x] - `p1` - Invoke the classification algorithm (`cpt-frontx-algo-upgrade-changeset-classify`) for that target against the baseline payload, the baseline manifest's `excludedSubtrees`, the candidate payload, and the candidate manifest's `excludedSubtrees`; accumulate the target's returned per-file operations and `skipped` paths, or, for a doubly-changed file or a nested-target conflict, the target and every path or contesting target it names - `inst-val-check-target`

### Classify a Target's Files Against Baseline and Candidate

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-algo-upgrade-changeset-classify`

**Input**: One target; the currently recorded origin (baseline) and its manifest's declared `excludedSubtrees`; the requested new origin (candidate) and its manifest's declared `excludedSubtrees`; `projectOwnedRoots`, `.frontx`, the reserved environment entries, and the template's own local origin folder (when installed by local path); every target already recorded across every registered template's `targets[]` in the project state store; the baseline payload and the candidate payload (each resolved).

**Output**: The target's per-file operations — a list of `{ target, path, op }` where `op` is one of `ADD`, `REPLACE`, `REMOVE`, `KEEP_LOCAL`, `UNCHANGED` — together with every payload path reported `SKIPPED` because it falls outside the candidate-bounded effective ownership or because it collides with the reserved temporary-file naming convention; or, for a doubly-changed file or another registered template's target nested inside newly claimed ground, the target and every such path or contesting target, for the caller to refuse the whole upgrade with `CONTENT_CONFLICT` or `TARGET_CONFLICT`.

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Compute the target's effective ownership boundary once, from the candidate manifest's declared `excludedSubtrees` together with `projectOwnedRoots`, `.frontx`, the reserved environment entries, and the template's own local origin folder — the same six-term subtraction `cpt-frontx-algo-cli-scaffolding-uniform-apply` performs (`inst-ua-compute-ownership`) — never the baseline manifest's `excludedSubtrees`, and never recomputed per path - `inst-cls-compute-candidate-boundary`
2. [x] - `p1` - Compute the target's effective ownership boundary the same way from the baseline manifest's declared `excludedSubtrees` — the boundary the target's content was actually written through at its last apply or upgrade - `inst-cls-compute-baseline-boundary`
3. [x] - `p1` - **FOR EACH** path, in the baseline payload or the candidate payload, that falls outside the candidate boundary computed above — whether because the candidate manifest's `excludedSubtrees` now excludes ground the baseline owned, or because `projectOwnedRoots`, `.frontx`, a reserved environment entry, or the template's own local origin folder excludes it regardless of what changed between the two manifests, including ground a nested other template's target already legitimately occupies (always inside a declared `excludedSubtrees` entry, per `cpt-frontx-algo-cli-scaffolding-conflict-check`'s own containment rule) — leave its on-disk content exactly as it is, make no comparison for it, and record it `SKIPPED` - `inst-cls-skip-excluded`
4. [x] - `p1` - **FOR** the ground that falls inside the candidate boundary but was outside the baseline boundary — ground the candidate no longer excludes, newly claimed and ordinary eligible ground — resubmit it against every other registered template's already-recorded targets through the nesting-aware check (`cpt-frontx-algo-cli-scaffolding-conflict-check`) - `inst-cls-if-newly-claimed-nested`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **IF** another template's target nests inside that ground, record the target and the contesting template as a nested-target conflict for this target; the rest of that ground remains ordinary eligible ground for classification below - `inst-cls-record-nested-conflict`

      KNOWN GAP, stated rather than left implicit: this check covers only targets belonging to a DIFFERENT registered template, because that is the ownership boundary the nesting-aware check (`cpt-frontx-algo-cli-scaffolding-conflict-check`) arbitrates. A name applied to two targets where one nests inside ground the other's baseline manifest excluded — sibling targets of the SAME name — is therefore unguarded: if the candidate drops that exclusion, both targets' classifications can emit an operation for the same destination path with different content, and the last rename wins. No sequence of `apply`/`ownership` operations produces that arrangement today (`apply`'s own pre-flight check refuses same-name nesting unless declared), so this is a latent shape rather than a reachable defect, and closing it belongs with whichever decision first makes same-name nesting reachable.
5. [x] - `p1` - Enumerate every path appearing in the baseline payload or the candidate payload, confined to the candidate boundary computed above, excluding any path already reported `SKIPPED` — never every path the boundary merely admits, so a developer's own file, symlink, or directory sitting inside the boundary at a path neither payload ever declared is not enumerated, not compared, and never reaches the plan at all (`cpt-frontx-adr-project-upgrade-mechanism`: "a developer's own file or symlink sitting there that neither payload ever declared is not examined at all"). That exclusion is what keeps the plan reviewable: such a path would classify `KEEP_LOCAL` and write nothing, but it would still occupy a line in the plan a developer reviews and approves, and a target at the project root would bury the handful of real operations under one no-op line per file in the repository. A path matching the reserved temporary-file naming convention the commit algorithm's write phase uses (`inst-com-materialize-temp`) is excluded from comparison the same way — never compared — but not silently: it is instead recorded `SKIPPED`, naming the reserved-convention collision as the reason, exactly like a path the boundary itself excludes. That reporting is reached by a path a PAYLOAD declares; a stale temporary file merely sitting on disk is reclaimed by the commit algorithm's own first step (`inst-com-reclaim-stale-temp`), never by classification. A directory or a symlink where a payload DOES declare that exact path is still enumerated and refused fail-closed by `inst-cls-if-not-regular` below. For a published template, a payload path matching the reserved convention is refused outright before publication by the content self-containment validation `cpt-frontx-feature-template-manifest` owns (`inst-csc-if-reserved-name`, `cpt-frontx-algo-template-manifest-validate-content-self-containment`); a local `path:` origin has no publication step for that check to run against, so this `SKIPPED` reporting is the only guard such a payload ever meets - `inst-cls-enumerate`
6. [x] - `p1` - **FOR EACH** enumerated path - `inst-cls-foreach-path`
   1. [x] - `p1` - Read the path's content, or its absence, from the baseline payload, the candidate payload, and on disk; comparison is defined over absence explicitly — an absent path is unequal to any content, and two absences are equal - `inst-cls-read-three`
   2. [x] - `p1` - **IF** this path is carried by the baseline payload or the candidate payload, and the disk holds a directory or a symlink there instead of a regular file or an absence - `inst-cls-if-not-regular`
      1. [x] - `p1` - Record the path as doubly-changed for this target, fail-closed; no comparison is attempted - `inst-cls-record-not-regular`
   3. [x] - `p1` - **ELSE IF** the disk content already equals the candidate's content for this path — tested first, before every other branch below, including when both are absent, because there is nothing to do for a path already at its intended state regardless of what the baseline holds - `inst-cls-if-unchanged`
      1. [x] - `p1` - Classify the path `UNCHANGED` - `inst-cls-return-unchanged`
   4. [x] - `p1` - **ELSE IF** the path is present in the candidate, absent from the baseline, and absent on disk - `inst-cls-if-add`
      1. [x] - `p1` - Classify the path `ADD` - `inst-cls-return-add`
   5. [x] - `p1` - **ELSE IF** the candidate differs from the baseline and the disk content equals the baseline - `inst-cls-if-replace`
      1. [x] - `p1` - Classify the path `REPLACE` - `inst-cls-return-replace`
   6. [x] - `p1` - **ELSE IF** the path is present in the baseline, absent from the candidate, and the disk content equals the baseline - `inst-cls-if-remove`
      1. [x] - `p1` - Classify the path `REMOVE` - `inst-cls-return-remove`
   7. [x] - `p1` - **ELSE IF** the candidate equals the baseline and the disk content differs from the baseline — including a path both versions carry identically that the developer has deleted, where the deletion is itself the edit - `inst-cls-if-keep-local`
      1. [x] - `p1` - Classify the path `KEEP_LOCAL`; the developer's own edit stands and no write is ever planned for this path - `inst-cls-return-keep-local`
   8. [x] - `p1` - **ELSE** (the candidate differs from the baseline and the disk content differs from both the baseline and the candidate — including a candidate that adds a path the disk already carries content for that the baseline does not account for, and a path the developer deleted that the candidate also changes) - `inst-cls-else-conflict`
      1. [x] - `p1` - Record the path as doubly-changed for this target; it is not classified as an operation - `inst-cls-record-conflict`
7. [x] - `p1` - **IF** any path was recorded as doubly-changed, or a nested-target conflict was recorded, for this target - `inst-cls-if-any-conflict`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** the target and every doubly-changed path and every nested-target conflict it names, for the caller to refuse the whole upgrade with `CONTENT_CONFLICT` or `TARGET_CONFLICT`; no file is written, merged, or partially rewritten - `inst-cls-return-conflict`
8. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** the target's per-file operations list together with its `SKIPPED` paths - `inst-cls-return-ops`

### Commit the Atomic All-Targets Transition

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-algo-upgrade-changeset-commit`

**Input**: An approved operation plan (name, `targets[]`, `from {origin, version}`, `to {origin, version}`, `operations[]`).

**Output**: Every `ADD`/`REPLACE`/`REMOVE` operation landed within its target's effective ownership; `templates[name].origin`/`.version` committed to `to` together with the name's immediately preceding `{origin, version}`, as the transition's one commit point; the registered name's local inventory entry then promoted to the staged candidate content; the name's CLI-owned AI-extension bundle then refreshed. Or: when the pre-write verification finds a destination has drifted from what classification saw, `CONTENT_CONFLICT` naming every drifted destination, with no destination touched. Or: when an I/O failure anywhere inside the TRY is caught and recovery succeeds, every target, the project state store, and the inventory entry left exactly as they were before the attempt, `INTERNAL` naming the original failure. Or: when that recovery itself fails, `INTERNAL` naming both the original failure and every path recovery could not return. Or: when promotion fails after the commit point, `INTERNAL` naming the slot it could not replace, with the transition itself standing. Or: when the AI-extension bundle refresh fails after promotion, `INTERNAL` naming the bundle it could not refresh, with the transition and the promoted inventory entry both standing.

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - **TRY**: - `inst-com-try`
   1. [x] - `p1` - Before materialising any new temporary file, remove any stale temporary file matching the reserved naming convention below already inside any target's effective ownership — left behind by a prior attempt on this name that crashed before landing it - `inst-com-reclaim-stale-temp`
   2. [x] - `p1` - For every `ADD` and `REPLACE` operation across every target, materialise its new content into a temporary file beside its destination path, named by appending a reserved suffix this engine alone uses to the destination's own filename — a convention classification excludes from every comparison (`inst-cls-enumerate`), so a crash cannot leave litter that later classifies as a developer's own file — mutating no destination path in this step - `inst-com-materialize-temp`
   3. [x] - `p1` - Once every temporary file for every target of the name exists, and immediately before the first rename, verify that every destination the plan touches still holds exactly the content classification saw for it (or, for a `REMOVE`, still equals the baseline content classification saw) - `inst-com-verify-destinations`
   4. [x] - `p1` - **IF** any destination no longer matches what classification saw - `inst-com-if-drift-detected`
      1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `CONTENT_CONFLICT` naming every drifted destination; no destination has been touched at this point, so there is nothing to recover — this is a precondition check, never a recomputation, and it can only refuse, never change what was approved. A write that lands during the rename phase itself, after this check, is not detectable here; the repository's own version control is the remedy for that residual window - `inst-com-return-drift-conflict`
   5. [x] - `p1` - Once verification passes, land each `ADD`/`REPLACE` operation by an atomic rename of its temporary file over its destination — creating any parent directory the rename needs — and unlink each `REMOVE` operation's path without removing the directory it leaves empty, confined throughout to each target's effective ownership and never to a nested target belonging to another template; a `KEEP_LOCAL` or `UNCHANGED` path is never opened for writing - `inst-com-apply-within-boundary`
2. [x] - `p1` - **CATCH** any I/O failure inside the `TRY` — reclaiming a stale temporary file, materialising a new one, verifying a destination, or the destination-write step itself - `inst-com-catch`
   1. [x] - `p1` - Return each destination path already landed at the point of failure to its baseline state: write baseline content where the baseline payload carries the path (a landed `REPLACE`), and unlink where the baseline payload does not carry it (a landed `ADD` is reversed by unlinking, never by writing content the baseline does not have); re-resolve the baseline payload rather than reading it from any retained snapshot; write nothing to the project state document and nothing to the inventory entry. A failure caught before the first rename — during reclaim, materialisation, or verification — has landed no destination yet, so this step has nothing to return and is vacuously, trivially successful - `inst-com-restore-on-error`
   2. [x] - `p1` - **IF** every returned path lands back at its baseline state - `inst-com-if-recovery-succeeds`
      1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `INTERNAL` naming the original failure; every target, `templates[name]`, and the inventory entry are exactly as they were before the attempt, with no partial commit - `inst-com-return-failure`
   3. [x] - `p1` - **ELSE** (recovery itself fails for one or more paths) - `inst-com-else-recovery-fails`
      1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `INTERNAL` naming both the original failure and every path recovery could not return; `templates[name]` and the inventory entry remain untouched, though one or more destination paths may not be at their baseline state - `inst-com-return-recovery-failure`
3. [x] - `p1` - As the single atomic write that is this transition's commit point, write to the project state store: commit `templates[name].origin` and `.version` to `to`'s values together with the name's immediately preceding `{origin, version}` — the `from` this transition started at. This is the only atomic write in this algorithm; once it lands, the transition has committed regardless of what the next step does - `inst-com-commit-state`
4. [x] - `p1` - As a separate write to a separate store, never described as part of the write above, promote the staged candidate content into the registered name's own entry in the local template inventory - `inst-com-replace-inventory`
5. [x] - `p1` - **IF** that promotion fails - `inst-com-if-promotion-fails`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `INTERNAL` naming the slot it could not replace; the transition itself stands — `templates[name].origin`/`.version` and the preceding pair recorded in step 3 remain committed, because the slot's content is re-derivable by resolving the recorded origin, the same resolution every command that needs that content already performs - `inst-com-return-promotion-failure`
6. [x] - `p1` - The engine refreshes `name`'s CLI-owned AI-extension bundle at `.frontx/ai/<manifest-name>/` from the new payload's own `.frontx/ai/<manifest-name>/` convention folder, when present, through the same CLI-owned step `apply` and `delete` use (`cpt-frontx-algo-cli-scaffolding-ai-bundle`, `cpt-frontx-feature-cli-scaffolding`) - `inst-com-refresh-bundle`
7. [x] - `p1` - **IF** that refresh fails - `inst-com-if-bundle-refresh-fails`
   1. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** `INTERNAL` naming the bundle it could not refresh; the transition and the promoted inventory entry both stand, defined the same way a promotion failure is — because the bundle content is re-derivable from the same installed content path the refresh step reads - `inst-com-return-bundle-refresh-failure`
8. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** success: the operation plan applied and `templates[name]` updated for every target - `inst-com-return-success`

A hard crash — one this algorithm's own `CATCH` never observes — runs no recovery. A crash before the commit point (step 3) leaves the recorded entry still naming the baseline, so re-running the identical upgrade converges on the intended state by the disk-equals-candidate precedence rule (`inst-cls-if-unchanged`) rather than refusing: every path the crashed run had already landed already equals the candidate and needs no further write, every path it had not yet reached is landed normally, and any stale temporary file the crash left behind is reclaimed by that re-run's own first step. A crash after the commit point but before promotion or the bundle refresh completes leaves the transition committed and that later step incomplete; nothing depends on either being immediately current, since any later resolution of the name's now-recorded origin re-derives the same content. That convergence, together with the repository's own version control, is the whole remedy; no rollback journal is retained for it, because the baseline payload the recovery above depends on is re-resolvable rather than stored.

## 4. States (CDSL)

### Upgrade Lifecycle

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-state-upgrade-changeset-lifecycle`

This machine models exactly one engine invocation, forward or restore, from the moment it reads its baseline to the moment it terminates. A later invocation — another `upgrade`, or `--restore` — is a fresh instance of this same machine, starting again at `BASELINE_READ`; no state below is given an outgoing transition back to it.

**States**: BASELINE_READ, VALIDATED, REFUSED, NOOP, PRESENTED, APPROVED, COMMITTED, DECLINED

**Initial State**: BASELINE_READ

**Transitions**:
1. [x] - `p1` - **FROM** BASELINE_READ **TO** VALIDATED **WHEN** the new origin resolves, declares the same identity as the registered name, and validates against every target in `targets[]` - `inst-st-read-to-validated`
2. [x] - `p1` - **FROM** BASELINE_READ **TO** REFUSED **WHEN** the name is not registered, its `targets[]` is empty, no preceding `{origin, version}` is recorded for a restore (`NOTHING_TO_RESTORE`), the recorded `version` no longer matches what the recorded `origin` reports (`VERSION_MISMATCH`), the new origin cannot be resolved, it declares a different identity, a file inside any target has both moved away from the baseline and does not already match the candidate (`CONTENT_CONFLICT`), or another registered template's target nests inside ground the candidate newly claims (`TARGET_CONFLICT`); `templates[name]` is unchanged for every target - `inst-st-read-to-refused`
3. [x] - `p1` - **FROM** BASELINE_READ **TO** NOOP **WHEN** the resolved candidate's `{origin, version}` equals the baseline's own; no plan is computed, nothing is written, and, for a restore, the preceding pair is left exactly as it is - `inst-st-read-to-noop`
4. [x] - `p1` - **FROM** VALIDATED **TO** PRESENTED **WHEN** the transition has been built and shown to the developer for review - `inst-st-validated-to-presented`
5. [x] - `p1` - **FROM** PRESENTED **TO** APPROVED **WHEN** the developer grants explicit approval - `inst-st-presented-to-approved`
6. [x] - `p1` - **FROM** PRESENTED **TO** DECLINED **WHEN** the developer declines the transition; nothing is written - `inst-st-presented-to-declined`
7. [x] - `p1` - **FROM** APPROVED **TO** REFUSED **WHEN** the pre-rename verification finds a destination has drifted from what classification saw (`CONTENT_CONFLICT`, no destination touched), or an I/O failure during the destination-write step is caught and recovery succeeds (`INTERNAL`, every target and `templates[name]` exactly as before) or itself fails (`INTERNAL` naming both failures, `templates[name]` untouched though a destination may not be at baseline); nothing is committed to the project state store in any of these - `inst-st-approved-to-refused`
8. [x] - `p1` - **FROM** APPROVED **TO** COMMITTED **WHEN** the engine applies the transition within every target's effective ownership and commits `origin`/`version` atomically for the name, including when the inventory promotion after that commit point fails (`INTERNAL` naming the slot, the transition itself still landing here) — a restore's own commit lands in this same state, not a distinct one, since restore is this engine run against the recorded preceding `{origin, version}` as its candidate - `inst-st-approved-to-committed`

## 5. Definitions of Done

### Atomic All-Targets Validation and Review

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dod-upgrade-changeset-computation`

The system **MUST** read a registered name's `{origin, version, targets[]}` entry from the project state store (`cpt-frontx-feature-composed-provenance`) as the sole baseline, refusing with `TEMPLATE_NOT_REGISTERED` when the name has no entry, with `TARGET_NOT_APPLIED` when its `targets[]` is empty, and with `VERSION_MISMATCH` when the recorded `version` no longer matches what the recorded `origin` reports — a baseline the project state misreports is not a baseline to diff from; resolve a candidate new origin through the shared resolver without replacing the registered name's own entry in the local template inventory, confirm it declares the same manifest identity as the registered name, treat a candidate resolving to the baseline's own `{origin, version}` as an idempotent no-op that computes no plan and consumes no reversal, and otherwise compute, once per target, the effective ownership boundary from the candidate manifest's declared `excludedSubtrees` alone — never the baseline manifest's, and never recomputed per path. Every payload path that falls outside that boundary, for any of its subtraction terms — the candidate manifest's `excludedSubtrees` now excluding ground the baseline owned, or `projectOwnedRoots`, `.frontx`, a reserved environment entry, or the template's own local origin folder excluding it regardless of what changed between the two manifests, including ground a nested other template's target already legitimately occupies — **MUST** be left untouched on disk and reported `SKIPPED`; a payload path inside that boundary which instead collides with the reserved temporary-file naming convention **MUST** likewise be excluded from classification and reported `SKIPPED`, naming that collision, never silently dropped from the plan; ground the candidate no longer excludes **MUST** be classified as ordinary eligible ground, refusing with `TARGET_CONFLICT` where another registered template's target nests inside it. For every path inside the resulting boundary, the system **MUST** test first, before any other classification, whether the on-disk content already equals the candidate's — including when both are absent — and only then apply `ADD`/`REPLACE`/`REMOVE`/`KEEP_LOCAL`/`UNCHANGED`; comparison is defined over absence explicitly (an absent path is unequal to any content, two absences are equal), and a payload path where the disk holds a directory or a symlink instead of a regular file **MUST** refuse fail-closed as a doubly-changed path. The system **MUST** present the resulting operation plan, including every `SKIPPED` path, to the developer before writing any project file, and **MUST** refuse the entire upgrade — writing nothing and leaving every target's recorded `origin`/`version` and the inventory entry unchanged — with `ORIGIN_UNAVAILABLE` when the origin cannot be resolved, with `REGISTRATION_CONFLICT` when it declares a different identity, with `CONTENT_CONFLICT` naming every target and path where a file has both moved away from the baseline and does not already match the candidate, or with `TARGET_CONFLICT` naming every target and template where the candidate newly claims nested ground (`target`).

### Atomic All-Targets Commit

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dod-upgrade-changeset-apply`

The system **MUST** land an approved operation plan through a staged write: reclaim any stale temporary file matching the reserved naming convention below already inside any target's effective ownership, then materialise every `ADD`/`REPLACE` operation's new content into a temporary file beside its destination, named by appending a reserved suffix this engine alone uses to the destination's own filename, mutating no destination path in this step; classification **MUST** exclude every path matching that convention from every comparison, so a crash cannot leave litter that later classifies as a developer's own file. Once every temporary file for every target of the name exists, and immediately before the first rename, the system **MUST** verify that every destination the plan touches still holds exactly the content classification saw for it, refusing the whole upgrade with `CONTENT_CONFLICT` naming every drifted destination — with no destination touched — when it does not; this is a precondition check, never a recomputation. Only then **MUST** the system land each `ADD`/`REPLACE` by an atomic rename over its destination — creating any parent directory the rename needs — and unlink each `REMOVE` without removing the directory it leaves empty, never opening a `KEEP_LOCAL` or `UNCHANGED` path for writing, confined throughout to each target's effective ownership and never to a nested target belonging to another template. As the single atomic write that is this transition's commit point, after every target's destination writes have landed, the system **MUST** commit `origin` and `version` to the approved plan's `to` values together with the name's immediately preceding `{origin, version}` — a write to the project state store alone, never described together with the step after it as one atomic write. As a separate step after that commit point, the system **MUST** promote the staged candidate content into the registered name's own entry in the local template inventory, and, if that promotion fails, **MUST** return `INTERNAL` naming the slot it could not replace while leaving the transition itself committed, because the slot's content is re-derivable by resolving the recorded origin. On any I/O failure caught inside the staged write — whether while reclaiming a stale temporary file, materialising a new one, verifying a destination, or landing a rename or unlink — the system **MUST** attempt to return every destination path already landed at the point of failure to its baseline state — writing baseline content where the baseline carries the path, unlinking where it does not, since a landed `ADD` is reversed by unlinking rather than by writing content the baseline does not have — and **MUST** write nothing to the project state store or the inventory entry either way; a failure caught before the first rename has landed no destination, so this recovery is vacuously, trivially successful. When that recovery succeeds, every target is left exactly as it was before the attempt and the system **RETURN**s `INTERNAL` naming the original failure; when recovery itself fails for one or more paths, the system **RETURN**s `INTERNAL` naming both the original failure and every path recovery could not return. A hard crash that this catch never observes runs no recovery at all; before the commit point, the recorded entry still names the baseline, and re-running the identical upgrade converges on the intended state through the disk-equals-candidate precedence rule rather than refusing, reclaiming any stale temporary file the crash left behind — no rollback journal is retained, since the baseline payload recovery depends on is re-resolvable rather than stored. A successful commit **MUST** refresh the name's CLI-owned AI-extension bundle at `.frontx/ai/<manifest-name>/` from the new payload, through the same CLI-owned step `apply` and `delete` use (`cpt-frontx-algo-cli-scaffolding-ai-bundle`), never through the template's own ownership, and, if that refresh fails, **MUST** return `INTERNAL` naming the bundle it could not refresh while leaving the transition and the promoted inventory entry standing, defined the same way a promotion failure is (`target`).

### Restore to Pre-Upgrade State

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-dod-upgrade-changeset-rollback`

The system **MUST** allow a developer to restore a registered name to its immediately preceding `origin`/`version` and, within the preceding manifest's boundary, its preceding applied content, atomically across every target of the name, invoked as `frontx upgrade <templateName> --restore` with no origin argument, by invoking `cpt-frontx-algo-upgrade-changeset-validate` exactly once — never resolving the preceding origin separately beforehand — with the recorded preceding `{origin, version}` as the candidate and the currently recorded entry as the baseline, checking whether that invocation refused **before** presenting any plan, and, only once it has not, presenting the plan and, on approval, invoking `cpt-frontx-algo-upgrade-changeset-commit` to land it and record the origin the name is now leaving as its new preceding origin. Every outcome that same commit algorithm can return after approval — the pre-rename drift refusal (`CONTENT_CONFLICT`, nothing touched), a recovered I/O failure (`INTERNAL`, everything exactly as before), a failed recovery (`INTERNAL` naming both the original failure and every path it could not return), a promotion failure after the commit point (`INTERNAL` naming the slot, the transition itself standing), or an AI-extension bundle refresh failure after promotion (`INTERNAL` naming the bundle, the transition and the promoted inventory entry both standing) — **MUST** be reachable and reported by this flow exactly as the forward flow reports it; restore reports no unconditional success. A file the forward upgrade added into ground the current manifest had newly claimed lies outside the preceding manifest's boundary and **MUST** stay in place, reported `SKIPPED` rather than reverted. The system **MUST** refuse with `TEMPLATE_NOT_REGISTERED` when the name has no entry, with `TARGET_NOT_APPLIED` when `targets[]` is empty, with `NOTHING_TO_RESTORE` only when no preceding `{origin, version}` is recorded for the name, and, inherited from the single validation invocation, with `VERSION_MISMATCH` when either the currently recorded entry's own honesty check fails or the recorded preceding origin resolves but reports a version different from the one recorded beside it, with `ORIGIN_UNAVAILABLE` when the recorded preceding origin cannot be resolved at all, with `REGISTRATION_CONFLICT` when its manifest declares a different identity, with `CONTENT_CONFLICT` naming every doubly-changed target and path, or with `TARGET_CONFLICT` naming every target and template where the preceding manifest no longer excludes nested ground — no refusal reachable by two of these codes. A successful restore **MUST** record the origin it just left as the new preceding origin, so a restore is itself reversible with no special case — a second restore in a row moves the name back to the origin the first restore came from, never `NOTHING_TO_RESTORE`, because reversal reaching back exactly one generation means the generation before that is unreachable, not that a second attempt fails — and **MUST NOT** retain any content snapshot for this purpose — the preceding payload is re-resolved from the preceding origin exactly as any other baseline is (`cpt-frontx-fr-cli-upgrade-restore`). The preceding pair is absent until a name's first upgrade or after a `register --replace` clears it, and its absence leaves the project state document structurally valid.

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Invoking `upgrade <templateName> <new-origin>` for a registered name with at least one applied target produces a reviewable operation plan covering every target under that name, and writes no project file until the developer approves.
- [x] The baseline read for the upgrade is exactly `templates[templateName].{origin, version}` from the single project state document — no per-instance provenance record or per-file hash set is read or required to exist.
- [x] Approving the operation plan commits `templates[templateName].origin`/`.version` and its immediately preceding `{origin, version}` atomically, lands every `ADD`/`REPLACE`/`REMOVE` operation within every target's effective ownership, and replaces the local inventory entry; declining leaves the repository, the project state store, and the inventory entry byte-for-byte unchanged.
- [x] A file inside a target's effective ownership that only the developer has changed since the baseline survives an upgrade untouched, classified `KEEP_LOCAL`.
- [x] A file inside a target's effective ownership changed by both the candidate and the developer since the baseline, and not already matching the candidate, refuses the whole upgrade with `CONTENT_CONFLICT`, naming every such target and path, and writes nothing to any target, to the project state store, or to the local inventory entry.
- [x] A payload path where the disk holds a directory or a symlink instead of a regular file refuses fail-closed with `CONTENT_CONFLICT`, with no comparison attempted for that path.
- [x] The boundary a plan writes through is computed once per target, from the candidate manifest's declared `excludedSubtrees` alone, never from the baseline manifest's and never recomputed per path; every payload path that falls outside that boundary for any of its subtraction terms — `excludedSubtrees`, `projectOwnedRoots`, `.frontx`, a reserved environment entry, the template's own local origin folder, or ground a nested other template's target already legitimately occupies — is left untouched on disk and reported `SKIPPED`, never removed and never written, not only the ground the candidate newly excludes that the baseline owned.
- [x] Ground the candidate no longer excludes because it dropped an exclusion, where another registered template's target already nests inside it, refuses the whole upgrade with `TARGET_CONFLICT`, naming the contesting target and template, and writes nothing to any target, to the project state store, or to the local inventory entry.
- [x] A file the developer created with content byte-identical to what the candidate adds, a file the candidate removes that the developer already deleted, and every path a crashed run had already written before dying, all classify with nothing left to do and refuse nothing — the on-disk-equals-candidate precedence rule is tested before every other branch, including when both are absent.
- [x] A file both the baseline and the candidate carry identically that the developer has deleted classifies `KEEP_LOCAL`, the deletion standing as the edit; a file the developer deleted that the candidate also changes refuses with `CONTENT_CONFLICT`.
- [x] A declined operation plan writes nothing to any target, to the project state store, or to the local inventory entry.
- [x] `upgrade` against a name with no registered entry returns `TEMPLATE_NOT_REGISTERED`; against a name whose `targets` array is empty, the engine refuses with `TARGET_NOT_APPLIED` and directs the developer to `register --replace`.
- [x] A registered name whose recorded `version` no longer matches what its recorded `origin` reports is refused with `VERSION_MISMATCH` before the candidate origin is resolved and before any target is classified, naming the recorded and the reported version.
- [x] A new origin that fails to resolve returns `ORIGIN_UNAVAILABLE` before any target is classified.
- [x] A new origin whose manifest declares an identity different from the registered name being upgraded is refused with `REGISTRATION_CONFLICT`, naming both identities, with no target classified and no operation plan computed.
- [x] A new origin that resolves to the name's already-recorded `{origin, version}` is an idempotent no-op: no operation plan is computed, nothing is written, and the name's preceding pair is left unchanged.
- [x] An I/O failure during the destination-write step that recovery successfully reverses leaves every target, the project state store, and the inventory entry exactly as they were before the attempt, and returns `INTERNAL` naming the original failure; a failure recovery itself cannot fully reverse returns `INTERNAL` naming both the original failure and every path recovery could not return, with the project state store and the inventory entry still untouched.
- [x] Immediately before the first rename, with every temporary file already in place, a destination that no longer holds exactly what classification saw for it refuses the whole upgrade with `CONTENT_CONFLICT` naming every such destination, having touched no destination; this check never recomputes the plan, it only refuses.
- [x] A promotion failure after the project state store's commit point returns `INTERNAL` naming the slot it could not replace, while `templates[name].origin`/`.version` and its preceding pair remain committed — the transition stands, and the slot's content is re-derivable by resolving the recorded origin.
- [x] Every temporary file the write phase creates matches a reserved naming convention that classification excludes from every comparison, so a crashed run's leftover temporary file never classifies as the developer's own file; a stale temporary file matching that convention inside a target's effective ownership is reclaimed by the next upgrade of that name before it stages new ones.
- [x] A published template whose payload carries a path matching that reserved convention is refused outright at pre-publish validation (`cpt-frontx-feature-template-manifest`) and never reaches an installed inventory for `upgrade` to classify. A local `path:` template has no publication step for that check to run against, so the same colliding path can reach a plan; there, classification excludes it from every comparison and reports it `SKIPPED`, naming the collision, rather than silently dropping it.
- [x] An I/O failure caught while reclaiming a stale temporary file, materialising a new one, or verifying a destination — before any rename has landed — recovers vacuously (nothing to return) and returns `INTERNAL` naming the original failure, exactly as a failure during the destination-write step does.
- [x] An AI-extension bundle refresh failure after a successful promotion returns `INTERNAL` naming the bundle it could not refresh, while `templates[name].origin`/`.version`, its preceding pair, and the promoted inventory entry all stand committed.
- [x] A developer's own file, symlink, or ordinary directory sitting inside a target's effective ownership at a path neither payload carries is never enumerated, never compared, never reported in the plan, and never refuses the upgrade — the plan carries only paths a payload declares, so it stays reviewable as the handful of operations the upgrade actually performs; a payload path where the disk holds a directory or a symlink instead of a regular file still refuses fail-closed.
- [x] The reviewed operation plan equals the applied one: the plan a developer approves is exactly what lands, and the `origin`/`version` approved is exactly what is committed to the project state store.
- [x] `frontx upgrade <templateName> --restore` returns every target of a name to the preceding origin's content within the preceding manifest's boundary, and records the origin restore just left as the new preceding origin; a file the forward upgrade had added into ground the current manifest newly claimed lies outside that boundary and stays in place, reported `SKIPPED`.
- [x] An approved restore whose commit hits a pre-rename drift refusal, a recovered I/O failure, a failed recovery, or a promotion failure reports that outcome — never an unconditional success — with the same per-outcome state claim the forward flow reports for the identical commit outcome.
- [x] A second restore requested immediately after a first moves the name back to the origin the first restore had moved it away from, recording that origin as the new preceding origin — never `NOTHING_TO_RESTORE`; reversal reaching back exactly one generation means a third restore in a row toggles the name back again rather than reaching any earlier origin the mechanism has already overwritten.
- [x] Restore against a name with no entry is refused with `TEMPLATE_NOT_REGISTERED`; against a name whose `targets` array is empty, with `TARGET_NOT_APPLIED`, exactly as the forward direction; against a name with no preceding `{origin, version}` recorded, with `NOTHING_TO_RESTORE`; a recorded preceding origin that cannot be resolved at all is refused with `ORIGIN_UNAVAILABLE`; a recorded preceding origin that resolves but reports a version different from the one recorded beside it, or a currently recorded entry that fails its own honesty check, is refused with `VERSION_MISMATCH` — no refusal is reachable by two of these codes, and the plan is never presented when any of them applies.
- [x] Restore resolves the recorded preceding origin exactly once, inside the single invocation of `cpt-frontx-algo-upgrade-changeset-validate` it makes; it never resolves that origin a second time beforehand.
- [x] A successful, committed upgrade refreshes the name's CLI-owned `.frontx/ai/<manifest-name>/` bundle from the new payload, when the payload carries one, through the same CLI-owned step `apply`/`delete` use — never through the template's own ownership.
- [x] Both direct CLI invocation and AI-driven orchestration (`cpt-frontx-feature-ai-upgrade-orchestration`) drive the same change-set engine; no second upgrade implementation exists.
- [x] A developer can request restore of a name's most recently committed upgrade via `frontx upgrade <templateName> --restore` and observe the name and every one of its targets return, within the preceding manifest's boundary, to the preceding `origin`/`version` and applied content; requesting restore when no preceding entry is recorded for that name returns `NOTHING_TO_RESTORE`.
- [x] Every `RETURN`-level refusal in this feature's flows and algorithms names a code from the shared error-code vocabulary (`cpt-frontx-adr-cli-machine-readable-output`).
- [x] `upgrade` satisfies `cpt-frontx-cli-nfr-template-scale`'s upgrade-preparation threshold: preparing a reviewable upgrade change set for one registered template in a project with at least 20 registered templates, without requiring any unrelated template to upgrade.
- [x] `cfs --json validate --artifact packages/cli/architecture/features/upgrade-changeset/FEATURE.md --skip-code` returns PASS.
- [x] `cfs --json validate-toc packages/cli/architecture/features/upgrade-changeset/FEATURE.md` returns PASS.
