# UI Kit — Design

Status: in development (MVP)
Repo-doc only, not published with the package. Backing CDSL artifacts (PRD
requirement, DESIGN component, FEATURE) are planned; until they land the
package is covered by an `[[ignore]]` entry in `.cf-studio/config/artifacts.toml`
(same interim state as `@gears-frontx/telemetry`).

> **History.** The kit was designed and prototyped in the now-retired gears-web
> repository (issue gears-web#7): first as a shadcn-style source registry, then
> as an npm package, with the styling stack settled by the architects as
> **CSS Modules instead of Tailwind** and **Base UI instead of Radix**. The
> tsup + CSS Modules pipeline and the Button prototype were proven there and
> moved here as gears-web was decommissioned. Where published runtime libraries
> live in the FrontX architecture is tracked by #495.

## Problem

Front-end templates in the Constructor Fabric ecosystem — from which FrontX and
Studio assemble interfaces — each build their UI layer from scratch. There is no
standard component base for templates, and nothing AI agents can rely on to
generate screens consistently.

## Goals

- A curated set of React components covering a typical admin application.
- The **standard component base for FrontX templates**: one version everywhere,
  fixes and design updates propagate via a dependency bump.
- Self-contained styling: the package ships its own compiled CSS; consumers
  need no CSS framework, preprocessor, or build plugins.
- AI-ready: agents generate screens from the kit using its bundled docs.
- Curate, don't write: behavior comes from Base UI (headless, tested upstream);
  styles are authored as CSS Modules, translated from shadcn/ui's design.

## Non-goals (MVP)

- White-label theming APIs. Basic branding = overriding CSS-variable tokens;
  deep customization = fork the kit or build the template on another kit.
- Framework-agnostic components (React is a hard requirement).
- `data-table`, date-picker, charts, page layout templates, form validation
  integration (RHF/zod), i18n helpers, Storybook.

`insight-front` uses shadcn's `calendar`, `chart` and `sidebar`, and the kit
will not cover them — a known gap, not an oversight. `calendar` (date-picker)
needs `react-day-picker` + `date-fns` and `chart` (charts) needs `recharts`, so
both fall to the architecture's "behavior from Base UI, no extra runtime deps"
rule. `sidebar` (page layout templates) adds no dependencies but is a large
composite over `sheet`, `button`, `input`, `separator`, `skeleton` and
`tooltip` plus a mobile-detection hook: app layout, not a base component.

The F-mockups draw larger blocks too — Sidebar Navigation, Top Bar / Page
Header, an App Shell, a Data Table with toolbar, bulk-selection bar and row
states, and the Studio AI cards. Those frames are titled "MVP Building
blocks / shadcn compositions" in the design file itself: compositions over
kit primitives, not kit components. They stay with consumers/templates, and
the kit's contribution is composition recipes (see AI layer) — which keeps
the `sidebar` / `data-table` exclusions above intact.

## Architecture

- Component stack: **React 19 + Base UI (`@base-ui/react`) + CSS Modules + CVA**.
- Build: **Vite library mode**, ESM only (no CJS build). One entry per
  component — `src/components/<name>/public.ts`, globbed — plus the
  `src/index.ts` barrel, mirroring Constructor's internal react-kit
  (`scripts/buildPlugin.ts` there) rather than tsup's single-entry bundle.
  Per-entry splitting is what makes the kit tree-shakeable at both the JS and
  CSS level, *including through the barrel*: each entry compiles to its own
  `dist/<name>.js` + `dist/<name>.d.ts` (`vite-plugin-dts`, with a small
  `afterBuild` hook writing the flat `dist/<name>.d.ts` a consumer's `./*`
  subpath import resolves to — see `scripts/buildPlugin.ts`) and its own CSS
  chunk (`vite-plugin-lib-inject-css`); `dist/index.js` only re-exports those
  already-separate files, so a consumer's bundler can drop the ones it never
  imports rather than receiving one bundle with everything inlined.
  `rollup-plugin-node-externals` externalizes `dependencies`/
  `peerDependencies` (`@base-ui/react`, CVA, `lucide-react`, react, react-dom
  and subpaths like `react/jsx-runtime`) in place of tsup's hand-maintained
  `external` array. CSS Modules support is native to Vite — the esbuild `local-css`
  loader override tsup needed (and the fragile convention its comment
  documented, that JS may only import `*.module.css`) is gone.
- CSS pipeline: per-component `*.module.css`, each compiled to its own CSS
  chunk and auto-imported by that component's JS chunk
  (`vite-plugin-lib-inject-css`) — no combined stylesheet, no `./styles.css`
  export; importing a component's JS is what pulls in its CSS. Design tokens
  remain a plain-CSS file (`./theme.css` export), hand-copied into `dist/` at
  build, unchanged: Vite's lib build only emits CSS reachable from a JS
  import, and theme.css is deliberately never imported by JS. A consumer
  imports `theme.css` once; component CSS then arrives for free with each
  component import. No PostCSS/Tailwind requirements on either side.
- Theme: semantic CSS variables (colors, spacing, radii, control metrics,
  and the Studio type ramp — families plus per-role size/line-height/
  weight/tracking, `--text-<role>-*` for display/heading-1/heading-2/body/
  label/meta/mono; see step 4 below), light/dark via `data-theme` /
  `prefers-color-scheme`; shadcn-style token structure carrying the Studio
  palette from the F-mockups Figma file (variable collection "Studio /
  shadcn"). Component CSS consumes only these variables — the theme file is
  the single seam between kit styles and consumer brand. The theme file
  also paints the page surface itself (`body`/`[data-theme]` background and
  color, plus `color-scheme`), not just the tokens: a bare consumer page
  goes correctly dark under `prefers-color-scheme` with no attribute and no
  CSS of its own.
- Publishing: version-gated like every ecosystem package. Originally
  `private: true` gated *any* publication on the full MVP set plus #495; that
  gate was consciously revised (2026-08-07) — the `alpha` pre-release channel
  opened with the 19-component set so templates can consume the kit while the
  remaining MVP components land. The original gates now guard the *stable*
  (`latest`) release instead: the full MVP component set, #495 approving the
  package's architecture ownership, traceability, and version policy, and the
  required CDSL artifacts replacing the temporary `artifacts.toml` ignore.

## Component set (MVP, 31 components)

19 built, 12 planned — the ⏳-marked entries are the `insight-front` gap set
plus the two the F-mockups added (`pagination`, `breadcrumb`), delivery-plan
step 5 (see below), not yet in the package.

| Group    | Components |
|----------|------------|
| Forms    | `button`, `input`, `textarea`, `select`, `checkbox`, `radio-group`, `switch`, `label`, `field`, ⏳ `toggle`, ⏳ `toggle-group` |
| Overlays | `dialog`, `dropdown-menu`, `tooltip`, `toast`, ⏳ `popover`, ⏳ `sheet`, ⏳ `preview-card` |
| Structure| `card`, `tabs`, `badge`, `separator`, `skeleton`, ⏳ `alert`, ⏳ `avatar`, ⏳ `breadcrumb`, ⏳ `collapsible`, ⏳ `empty`, ⏳ `spinner` |
| Data     | `table` (primitive markup), ⏳ `pagination` |

Behavior and accessibility come from Base UI primitives; variant logic is CVA;
styles are CSS Modules translated from shadcn/ui's Tailwind design (MIT,
attribution in this package's NOTICE). Wrapping conventions follow Constructor's
internal react-kit (gitlab.constr.dev/frontend/react-kit): per-component
directories, colocated tests and docs, `render`-prop polymorphism. A composite
`data-table` is deliberately deferred.

Ten entries — `toggle`, `toggle-group` (Forms), `popover`, `sheet`,
`preview-card` (Overlays), `alert`, `avatar`, `collapsible`, `empty`, `spinner`
(Structure) — come from the kit's first consumer, `insight-front`
(`constructorfabric/insight-front`): of the shadcn/Base UI components that team
uses today, these are the ones the kit lacked. `toggle` and `toggle-group` wrap
`@base-ui/react/toggle` and `/toggle-group`; `avatar` and `collapsible` have
Base UI primitives too. `alert`, `empty` and `spinner` are pure styling with no
primitive, like `card`, `badge` and `skeleton`. All three new overlays portal
their popup, so each needs the same `container` escape hatch the existing
overlays document. Two names diverge from their sources and will confuse the
next reader: shadcn's registry calls `preview-card` `hover-card`, and `sheet`
maps onto Base UI's `drawer` primitive.

`pagination` and `breadcrumb` come from the F-mockups instead: the mockups'
component mapping pairs pagination with the table (Toolbar · Row ·
Pagination) and places breadcrumb inside the Top Bar composition. Both are
pure markup/styling with no Base UI primitive, like `card` and `badge`;
shadcn ships both, so the usual translation path applies.

`toast` is built on Base UI's own Toast primitive (`@base-ui/react/toast`),
not sonner: base-vega ships a `sonner.json` variant too, but that pulls in
`sonner` + `next-themes` as extra runtime dependencies, breaking the kit's
"behavior from Base UI, no extra runtime deps" architecture for the sake of
one component. Base UI's Toast keeps sonner's call-anywhere ergonomics
(`toast.add({...})` from any file, no JSX composed at the call site) via its
own manager object, without the extra dependencies.

## AI layer

Shipped in the package so agents read it from `node_modules`: `llms.txt` at
the package root (entry point: setup rules + component index) and a short
usage doc per component (when to use, kit-level props, examples,
anti-patterns) colocated as `src/components/<name>/<name>.md` and copied to
`dist/docs/` at build. A unit test enforces that every component has a doc,
is indexed in `llms.txt`, and documents every variant/size its CSS module
defines. Still planned: composition recipes — the original trio (CRUD page,
settings form, confirmation dialog) plus the F-mockups' building blocks
(app shell with sidebar navigation, data-table page with toolbar and
bulk-selection bar). The trio's components all exist, so writing those is
unblocked; the mockup-block recipes additionally wait on step-5 components
(`pagination`, `breadcrumb`, `avatar`).

## Testing and acceptance

- Unit tests are written along with components: render + interaction smoke per
  component (vitest + jsdom + testing-library, versions pinned by the root
  test-dependency gate).
- Kitchen-sink demo app: started as `demo/` inside the package (`npm run
  demo`) — the same in-package pattern the telemetry demo actually uses,
  superseding the separate `packages/ui-kit-example-web` package an earlier
  revision of this plan named. Two hash-routed pages sharing an
  auto/light/dark switch (`#/tokens`: the full token set — color swatches,
  radius/spacing/control scales, and the Studio type ramp; `#/components`:
  all 19 components in every variant/size/state) — split from the original
  single page once both grew large enough to want their own scroll; see
  `demo/README.md`. Consumes the package by name, so it exercises the built
  artifact, not src. Grow it to every component in every state as the set
  lands; it doubles as the agent playground.
- Acceptance: (1) `scripts/verify-consumer.sh` packs the package, installs the
  tarball into a clean Vite project, builds a page that imports a single
  component (`Button`) and asserts tokens, that component's styles and class
  map are present in the bundle — *and*, the proof the repackaging exists
  for, that a component never imported (`Table`, `Dialog` — both have large,
  distinctive CSS) is absent from both the JS and CSS output; (2) an agent
  assembles a CRUD screen from kit components from a single prompt using the
  bundled docs.

## Risks

1. The kit dictates React for consumers — acceptable for ecosystem templates.
2. Fork is the only deep-customization path — accepted; the standard optimizes
   for consistency across templates.
3. Authored styles replace curated styles — the largest share of MVP effort and
   where visual bugs will live; the kitchen-sink demo exists to catch them.

## Delivery plan

Oldest first; steps 1–4 are done (step 4's design answers are still
pending, see its entry), 5–6 remain. The first `alpha` publication
(0.3.0-alpha.1, 2026-08-07) happened *before* step 5, per the revised
Publishing gate above — steps 5–6 now gate the stable release, not
publication as such. Completed
steps are a log, not a description of the current build (see Architecture
for that; the tsup pipeline step 1 names was later replaced by Vite, per
Architecture's build bullet).

1. Package skeleton + proven tsup/CSS Modules pipeline (later replaced by
   Vite; see Architecture) + Button.
2. Tokens polish + first component batch (forms) on `@base-ui/react`.
3. Remaining components — done, the 19-component MVP set exists.
4. **Studio reskin (done, design answers pending).** The design source
   moved from shadcn's neutral defaults to the Studio design: the
   F-mockups Figma file, page `00 · Foundations`, tokens from its
   "Studio / shadcn" variable collection. Landed: theme.css carries the
   palette and the new token groups (see Architecture's theme bullet), and
   the existing components follow the mockups' component specs — Badge on
   semantic intents (`pill`/`plain` shapes, with `dot` and `icon` both
   opt-in; the shadcn variant list retired), Button's
   `icon` slot + auto icon-only + `loading`, Tabs on the trackless Kind=tab
   look (the spec's Kind=segment is the planned `toggle-group`'s styling,
   per the design file's own component description), the unified Field set
   for Input/Textarea/Select with the `filter` type (Select's compact
   toolbar chip) and `search`'s native searchbox role (no automatic icon;
   pass one via `icon`), Table
   density + selected/stale/restricted row hooks, and component CSS on the
   metric tokens. The drawn-vs-spec control-height discrepancy was ruled
   in favor of the drawn specimens (32/36/40; buttons map sm/default/lg
   directly, fields sit on the lg step, the filter chip on md). A later
   typography pass added `--font-sans`/`--font-mono` (families only — the
   kit ships no font files) and the Studio type ramp as `--text-<role>-*`
   tokens (frame 175:371), then moved the remaining shadcn-legacy 14px
   text onto ramp roles: Body for card/dialog/toast/tab-panel/caption
   text, Label for button-role text (the drawn buttons are bound to the
   Studio/Label style), Meta for field helpers and Badge; dropdown/select
   options and the tooltip follow the drawn Overlay specimen (12/17)
   instead. A follow-up ruling then settled the metric conflicts
   wholesale: the token system wins over hand-set specimen values.
   Component CSS now consumes the token scales
   everywhere — off-grid drawn spacing snapped to the nearest --space-*
   step (the fields' 10px → 12, menu options' 6px → 8, the compact
   table's 6px → 4), the specimens' 13/18 and 12/17 text normalized onto
   Label/Meta, and the 10px table header onto Meta at the lg control
   height — and a tokens.test.ts guard now rejects literal metrics in
   spacing and type declarations (documented exceptions: the fields' 16px
   iOS anti-zoom floor, the switch thumb's 2px inset geometry). Still
   open: the token values marked `derived:` in theme.css; and the drawn
   Overlay options' muted/active color language (a component-phase item,
   not a token one).

   **Accessibility + spec-alignment pass.** A pass over the reskin found
   WCAG failures and undocumented deviations from the drawn spec; all
   resolved as rulings rather than left flagged, per the standing
   instruction that a color failing WCAG gets a new color, not a "kept as
   drawn" footnote:
   - **Button focus rings** (every variant, both themes) now clear the
     3:1 floor against the page background. Originally shipped two-toned
     (an outer border color plus a separately colorable inset shadow,
     because the ring was drawn ON the button's edge and so had two WCAG
     neighbors — the page outside, the button's own fill inside) — revised
     after ship because `--info` (the `default` variant's outer tone) is
     cyan in dark mode and blue in light, a hue that appears nowhere else
     near the violet button, and because two custom properties per variant
     was more machinery than the fix needed. The ring now sits OUTSIDE the
     button instead (`outline` + `outline-offset`, not a border recolor
     plus inset shadow), so its only WCAG neighbor is ever the page
     background and a single tone per variant is enough: `default` and
     `destructive` get their own family color (new tokens
     `--primary-ring`/`--destructive-ring`, since violet/red read better
     against the page than the plain kit-wide ring does), everything else
     (`outline`, `secondary`, `ghost`, `link`) falls through to the
     kit-wide `--ring`. `outline` was already on `--ring`, unchanged by
     this revision. Ratios as measured (light/dark), with button.test.tsx
     recomputing them from the live CSS on every run:

     | variant | ring tone vs page bg |
     |---|---|
     | `default` | `--primary-ring` 6.79 / 7.23 |
     | `destructive` | `--destructive-ring` 6.01 / 7.89 |
     | `outline`, `secondary`, `ghost`, `link` | `--ring` 4.05 / 3.78 |

     `outline`/`secondary`/`ghost`/`link` share one number because they all
     resolve to the same `--ring` token; 3.78 (dark) is the tightest in the
     table and the one to watch if `--ring` ever moves.
   - **`--subtle-foreground`** (the table header label): each mode's drawn
     value failed the 4.5:1 AA floor against the header's own `--surface`
     fill — light `#94a3b8` at 2.56:1, dark `#667085` at 3.74:1. Both
     corrected to values clearing 4.5:1 (theme.css). Note the measurement
     is per-mode against that mode's fill: `#94a3b8` reads 7.25:1 on the
     dark `--surface` and fails only in light. Open designer question: pin
     AA-passing values in the Figma file for both modes.
   - **Button's `link` variant** had no drawn counterpart and read
     `--primary` directly (3.78:1 dark, a clear AA fail); given a
     text-safe `--link-foreground` token instead (theme.css). Light takes
     `--primary-hover`'s value — 4.98:1, real headroom — rather than
     `--primary`'s own, which clears the 4.5:1 floor by 0.005 and would
     silently fail again on any one-step nudge to `--background`.
   - **Outline variant fill/border** aligned to the drawn "secondary"
     specimen (`--surface-elevated` + `--border-strong`, was `--background`
     + `--border`) — the button.md-documented outline↔secondary mapping
     was already correct, only the paint wasn't.
   - **Ghost variant rest text** aligned to the drawn `--muted-foreground`
     (was always `--foreground`) — verified first that `--muted-foreground`
     clears 4.5:1 against the page background in both themes before
     aligning, per the standing "recolor only if it still passes" check.
   - **Disabled dim** unified on 0.42 everywhere (Button/Input/Textarea/
     Select, plus DropdownMenu's/Select's disabled items) — Checkbox/
     RadioGroup/Switch/Label already matched the mockups' 0.42 specimens;
     these were the outliers still at the shadcn-inherited 0.5.
   - **Hand-set `font-weight: 500`** (five spots: Table's header/footer,
     DropdownMenu's `.label`, Tooltip, Toast's `.title`) now read
     `--text-label-weight` — same numeral, but a real ramp reference
     instead of a literal, and their comments no longer claim a "Meta at
     500" style that has no entry in the Studio ramp.
   - **Badge label colors.** No raw status color clears 4.5:1 for the 12px
     label against all three surfaces it can sit on (the pill fill,
     `--card`, `--background`) — raw, in light: success 3.36:1, warning
     2.84:1, info 3.65:1. So `--badge-text` mixes `--foreground` into the
     accent; the dot keeps the raw color and is exempt from the 3:1
     non-text floor as pure decoration duplicating the label. Worst case
     across the three surfaces, light/dark:

     | variant | mix | ratio |
     |---|---|---|
     | `success` | 80/20 | 4.72 / 9.63 |
     | `info` | 80/20 | 5.04 / 10.12 |
     | `danger` | 80/20 | 5.63 / 4.96 |
     | `muted` | 80/20 | 5.70 / 6.91 |
     | `warning` | 70/30 | 4.91 / 11.26 |

     Warning is the lightest accent and misses at 80/20 (4.07:1 light),
     hence its deeper mix. These are `color-mix()` results, resolved by
     the browser at runtime — unlike Button's focus rings, no test can
     recompute them from the CSS, so this table is their only record.

   **Consumer-facing changes from this pass** (flagged for `insight-front`,
   the kit's first consumer — see the architecture's Non-goals/AI-layer
   framing for why that team migrates onto the kit's API rather than the
   kit chasing theirs):
   - Button's `loading` no longer sets the native `disabled` attribute; it
     now reports state via `aria-disabled` and stays focusable
     (`focusableWhenDisabled`, forced on while `loading` — see button.md
     and button.tsx). Consumer code asserting `button:disabled` in CSS, or
     the native `disabled` DOM property/`toBeDisabled()` in tests, will no
     longer see a `loading` Button that way; check `aria-disabled`/
     `aria-busy` instead. Also: a raw DOM listener attached via `ref`/
     `addEventListener` is not suppressed while `loading` the way `onClick`
     is — see button.md's anti-patterns note.
   - `--subtle-foreground` changed VALUE in both themes (light #94a3b8 ->
     #5f6f88, dark #667085 -> #7a8396) — same token name, same single
     consumer (Table's header label), but a visibly darker/dimmer color in
     both themes now that it clears AA against the header's fill.
   - Badge's props are `variant`/`shape`, not `intent`/`form`. The
     semantic-only rule is unchanged — the values are still states, never
     paint jobs — but it is carried by the value names and the doc rather
     than by an axis name only this component used, so every component in
     the kit is driven by `variant` (+ `size`, or the occasional real extra
     axis: Badge's `shape`, Table's `density`). `shape` rather than `size`
     because the values are pill vs. plain (dot is a separate opt-in flag,
     orthogonal to shape) and Badge has no size axis;
     not `form`, which is a real HTML attribute a styling prop would shadow
     for anyone rendering a form-associated element via `render`.
   - Four new tokens: `--link-foreground` (Button's `link` variant text),
     `--popover-border`/`--popover-shadow` (the ring-plus-shadow recipe
     every card-like popup — Dialog/DropdownMenu/Select/Toast — now shares
     instead of hand-duplicating; see Architecture's theme bullet), and
     `--ring-inset` (the inward thickness that lets a 2px ring — focus,
     `aria-invalid`, Table's selected row — thicken without changing the
     element's box; eight modules previously spelled the same `calc()` out
     by hand). None replace an existing consumer-facing token; a consumer
     overriding theme.css wholesale (rather than layering on top of it)
     should add these four to stay in sync.
5. The twelve gap components, mockups-first: `popover`, `alert`, `avatar`,
   `empty` are in both the mockups and the `insight-front` set and go first;
   `pagination` and `breadcrumb` are the mockups-only additions;
   `toggle`, `toggle-group`, `sheet`, `preview-card`, `collapsible`,
   `spinner` close the `insight-front` list. Before the stable release, not
   after: they are part of the MVP set the stable gate names, and the
   kitchen-sink app and composition recipes should cover the whole set once
   rather than be extended right after the stable release.
6. Composition recipes (incl. the mockup building blocks) + kitchen-sink to
   full coverage; satisfy the #495 gates, remove the temporary
   artifact ignore, then cut the first stable (`latest`) version.
