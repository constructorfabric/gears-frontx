/**
 * DefaultExtensionMounter - Concrete per-domain mount facade
 *
 * Composes `MountManager` (MFE load/mount/unmount primitives) and an
 * `ExtensionManager` reference (for mount-set bookkeeping) to implement the
 * per-domain `ExtensionMounter` contract.
 *
 * One instance is constructed by the registry per registered domain inside
 * `registerDomain` and exposed to the domain implementation via
 * `DomainContext.mounter`. The React `ExtensionDomainSlot` accesses this
 * instance via `registry.getMounter(domainId)`.

   * mount pipeline (and appending a second, duplicate container) a second

   *
   * `container` is never supplied by an external caller or action payload —

   * of the same extension). That is not a legitimate case to route around
   * gracefully — see the hard invariant check in `mount()` below.
