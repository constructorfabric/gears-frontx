/**
 * Realm-global mount-context rendezvous and inbound-bridge linking.
 *
 * Internal registry plumbing for cross-nesting reachability (MFES-6). NOT
 * exported from the package's public barrel (`src/index.ts`) — every export
 * here is reachable only from other files inside this package.
 *
 * Two responsibilities:
 *
 * 1. Mounting-bridge rendezvous: while `DefaultMountManager.mountExtension`
 *    is synchronously invoking an extension's `lifecycle.mount(...)`, the
 *    `ChildMfeBridge` handed to that extension is recorded at a
 *    `globalThis`-anchored, version-namespaced rendezvous point — not an
 *    ES-module-scoped variable — because the mounting extension and a
 *    registry it constructs synchronously inside its own `mount()` body may
 *    each hold their own independently loaded copy of this package
 *    (`cpt-frontx-adr-mfe-load-isolation`), and only `globalThis` (and object
 *    references explicitly passed across the boundary) reliably cross that
 *    boundary. If the extension's own `mount()` body synchronously
 *    constructs a further `MfeRegistry`, that new registry's constructor —
 *    running in either copy — reads the same rendezvous point and, if a link
 *    was registered for the found bridge, automatically adopts it as its own
 *    inbound bridge, with no configuration or method call.
 *
 * 2. Inbound-bridge link: the `InboundBridgeLink` a parent registry mints for
 *    a specific child bridge (`registerInboundBridgeLink`) is attached
 *    directly to that bridge OBJECT — via a well-known symbol property, not
 *    a module-scoped `WeakMap` — because a `WeakMap` created by one copy of
 *    this module is invisible to code executing in a different, independently
 *    loaded copy, whereas a property on the shared bridge object itself
 *    (passed by reference across the boundary the same way the bridge is)
 *    is visible to both. The link is how a nested registry propagates
 *    admission advertisements upward, escalates unresolved dispatches
 *    upward, and retracts advertisements on disposal — all without any new
 *    public method on `ChildMfeBridge`, `ParentMfeBridge`, or `MfeRegistry`.
 *
