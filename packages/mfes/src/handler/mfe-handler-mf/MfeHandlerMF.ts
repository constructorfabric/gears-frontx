/**
 * Module Federation MFE Handler Implementation
 *
 * Achieves per-runtime isolation by blob-URL'ing the entire module dependency
 * chain for each load() call. Each screen/extension load gets fresh evaluations
 * of all code-split chunks and shared dependencies — no module instances are
 * shared between runtimes, with no exception. A dependency cycle admits no
 * order in which blob URLs could be minted (a blob URL is produced BY its
 * content, so a module's URL cannot exist before every dependency's URL
 * does), so a cyclic graph fails the load with a diagnostic naming the
 * chunks on the cycle rather than resolving any module from its origin URL.
 *
 * Manifest-based loading:
 * - baseUrl is derived from manifest.metaData.publicPath
 * - expose chunk filename comes from entry.exposeAssets.js.sync[0]
 * - CSS paths come from entry.exposeAssets.css.sync/async
 * - shared dep standalone ESM files are resolved from manifest.shared[].chunkPath (relative to publicPath)
 * No remoteEntry.js parsing is required.
 *
 * Bare specifier rewriting for shared deps:
 * - Shared deps are fetched as standalone ESM files from each MFE's server (chunkPath relative to publicPath).
 * - Dependency order is derived from the fetched sources themselves, not from
 *   manifest.shared[]'s enumeration order; shared deps that import one another
 *   circularly admit no such order and fail the load with a diagnostic.
 * - Within expose chunks and their dependency chains, bare specifiers (e.g. from "react")
 *   are rewritten to the pre-built blob URLs for the corresponding shared dep.
 * - This gives per-load isolation without any MF 2.0 runtime involvement.

   * Race a single load attempt against `this.config.timeout`.
   *
   * `config.timeout` is consulted here rather than left unused: without a
   * race against a timer, `RetryHandler.retry` only retries on a thrown
   * error, so a load that hangs (network never resolves, a dependency
   * cycle, etc.) leaves the returned promise pending forever. Racing the
   * attempt against a timer converts that into BOUNDED FAILURE: after a
   * known wall-clock budget the caller gets a diagnostic `MfeLoadError`
   * instead of a promise that never settles.
   *
   * The race is also a recovery path, not only a bound.
   * {@link fetchSourceText} stores the in-flight fetch promise in the
   * handler-level, URL-keyed `sourceTextCache` (and
   * {@link fetchSharedDepSources} does the same in the
   * two-tier-keyed `sharedDepTextCache`) and evicts it only when
   * that promise REJECTS, so a fetch that never settles would never be
   * evicted and every retry would rejoin the same hung promise and expire
   * against its own budget in turn. On expiry this method therefore
   * releases the entries the abandoned attempt was waiting on, through
   * that attempt's {@link AttemptSourceTextLedger} and under the same
   * identity check the eviction-on-rejection uses, so the next attempt
   * issues its own fetch and can actually succeed.
   *
   * Releasing those cache entries is not cancellation: this method still
   * does not cancel the underlying fetch/blob-URL work in flight when the
   * timer wins the race — there is no `AbortController`
   * plumbed through this file (see the sibling {@link boundedMap} fan-out,
   * which relies on a `ChainBuildState` token rather than cancellation
   * for the same reason) — so a timed-out attempt's background work keeps
   * running to completion and its results are simply never observed by
   * this call.
   *
   * `this.config.timeout` is never `undefined` in practice — the
   * constructor fills `config.timeout ?? 30000`, and `??` only substitutes
   * `null`/`undefined`, so an explicit `0` (or any other falsy number)
   * passed by a caller survives the constructor unchanged. A timeout of
   * `0` is the conventional "disable the timeout" idiom, so it — and any
   * other non-positive value — is treated as "no timeout" below rather
   * than as a zero-delay timer that would fail every attempt immediately.
   *
   * This method races ONE attempt, not one `load()` call. `RetryHandler`
   * (see {@link RetryHandler.retry}) wraps every retry of a failed attempt
   * in its own call to this method, so with the defaults (`timeout: 30000`,
   * `retries: 2`) a single `load()` call's worst-case wall clock is roughly
   * `timeout × (retries + 1)` plus `RetryHandler`'s exponential backoff
   * between attempts — on the order of 90+ seconds, not the 30 seconds the
   * `timeout` field name alone would suggest.

  /**
   * Recursively create blob URLs for a module and all its static dependencies.
   *
   * Processes dependencies depth-first so that when a module's imports are
   * rewritten, all its dependencies already have blob URLs in the shared map.
   * Common dependencies are processed once per load (shared blobUrlMap).
   *
   * Concurrent calls for the same filename are deduplicated via the inFlight
   * map — callers await the same promise rather than returning early with no
   * result. This prevents a race where sibling ESM modules with top-level
   * await, and the sibling fan-out in {@link createBlobUrlChainInternal},
   * trigger overlapping resolution for the same dependency;
   * {@link resolveLazyChunk} is the current beneficiary that actually calls
   * back into this method from outside the static-import recursion.
   *
   * Cycle detection is tracked on the shared `inFlight` entry rather than on
   * any single call's recursion path, because the path a cycle is *detected*
   * on is not necessarily the path it was *created* on. A linear cycle
   * (chunk A imports B, B imports A) is visible on one call stack and a
   * simple "have I already seen this filename on my own way down" check
   * catches it. A cycle that closes across two independent branches does
   * not stay on one call stack: if a diamond (E imports A and B; A imports
   * C; B imports C; C imports back to B) fans A and B out concurrently, C is
   * reached only via A's path, so a plain per-call ancestor set never
   * contains "B" when C statically imports it — B was never on that
   * particular branch. Meanwhile B is independently blocked joining C's
   * `inFlight` promise (ordinary, legitimate dedup, not yet a cycle), so B
   * and C now await each other with no rejection, no timeout, and no retry
   * path (the `loadCache` entry never settles).
   *
   * `ancestors` is therefore not a per-call snapshot: it *is* the mutable
   * lineage stored on the filename's own `inFlight` entry (see
   * `LoadBlobState.inFlight`), threaded live through the recursion that
   * builds that filename's dependencies. When a second branch joins an
   * already in-flight filename instead of constructing it, that branch
   * contributes its own lineage into the joined entry's lineage before
   * awaiting it (synchronously, with no `await` between the check and the
   * contribution — the same discipline the `blobUrlMap`/`inFlight`
   * check-then-set already relies on, which is also why this method stays
   * non-`async`). Because the lineage object is shared by reference, that
   * contribution is visible the moment the joined filename's own
   * construction next reads it — including when it later closes the cycle
   * by requesting a dependency that is now present in its own (grown)
   * lineage. In the diamond above: B joining C's promise contributes B's
   * lineage into C's entry; when C's construction goes on to request B, its
   * own lineage now contains "B", the ordinary ancestor check fires, and C
   * fails the chain build instead of joining B's promise. A detected cycle
   * is fatal here, exactly as it is for circular shared deps in
   * {@link createBlobUrlsInDependencyOrder}: there is no order in which the
   * blob URLs on a cycle could be minted, and the alternative — leaving the
   * cycle-closing specifier pointing at a plain chunk URL — would evaluate
   * that module, and its whole origin-resolved subgraph, outside the load's
   * isolated graph.
