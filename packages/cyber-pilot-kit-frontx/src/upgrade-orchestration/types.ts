// PLAN CORRECTION (2026-07-14) — REOPENED: this module MUST NOT import from
// the CLI package. Per DESIGN §3.4 ("the only edge is @gears-frontx/mfes
// -> @gears-frontx/gts-plugin; every other artifact is standalone" /
// "The AI Tooling Framework coordinates with the CLI by orchestrating its
// public command surface, not by linking its engine") and ADR-0027 ("reaches
// the engine only through the CLI's invocation surface ... not a dependent
// of the CLI's command surface"), this kit reaches the single F14 engine
// (`cpt-frontx-feature-upgrade-changeset`) ONLY through the `frontx upgrade`
// COMMAND/INVOCATION SURFACE — never by importing the engine's exported
// functions or types. The shapes below are therefore LOCALLY defined,
// mirroring the command surface's JSON contract
// (`packages/cli/src/commands/upgrade.ts` / `packages/cli/src/upgrade/types.ts`)
// structurally rather than nominally, so this module never names
// the CLI package and this package never depends on it
// (cpt-frontx-dod-ai-upgrade-orchestration-single-engine).

/**
 * The engine's second positional argument is an ORIGIN, not a version —
 * `cpt-frontx-adr-project-upgrade-mechanism` fixes the surface as
 * `upgrade <templateName> <new-origin>` — while this orchestration's own
 * input is the target template VERSION (FEATURE §3 **Input**).
 * `inst-invoke-engine` is precisely what bridges the two: it requires "the
 * target version's RESOLVED origin", so the version is rebased onto the
 * origin the name is currently recorded at rather than handed to the engine
 * verbatim. Passing it verbatim is not a cosmetic mismatch — the engine
 * parses that argument as a source-spec, so a bare `0.2.0` is refused for
 * having no `host:` prefix, and the AI path would fail where the direct CLI
 * path succeeds.
 *
 * The ref is bounded by the FIRST `@` after the `host:` prefix, mirroring
 * the resolver's own grammar rather than re-deriving a second rule for the
 * same syntax (`spec-parser/parse.ts`'s `inst-parse-at-check`: "Only the
 * FIRST `@` bounds the selector, so a ref that itself contains one is
 * unaffected").
 *
 * A local `path:` origin is refused rather than guessed at: it carries no
 * ref to rebase, and a version names nothing inside a directory. Refusing
 * keeps the failure legible at the boundary that can explain it, instead of
 * handing the engine an origin string that means something else.
