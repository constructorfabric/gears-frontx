 * field(s) a given code declares, leaving the rest `undefined` — so a
 * per-code interface would describe a value that is never actually
 * produced or consumed anywhere in this package's own public surface
 * (DESIGN §3.3 lists no per-code error type).
 *
 * - `invalid-shell-subroute` — `value` (the offending shell subroute); the
 *   given `shellSubroute` contains `?`, `#`, or `&` — a grammar delimiter
 *   that would otherwise reparse into a different, corrupted structure the
 *   moment the written URL is read back (FEATURE §3, Grammar Serialize,
 *   step 0). A shell subroute that reached serialize by way of grammar
 *   parse can never contain one of these three characters by construction
 *   (parse cuts the shell subroute off at the first `?`); this throw exists
 *   for the caller that builds a `SerializeInput` by hand instead.
 * - `invalid-foreign-segment` — `value` (the offending segment); a given
 *   `foreignSegments` entry contains `&` or `#` — the same reparse hazard as
 *   `invalid-shell-subroute`, for the other input a hand-built
 *   `SerializeInput` controls directly (FEATURE §3, Grammar Serialize, step
 *   1). A foreign segment that reached serialize by way of grammar parse
 *   can never contain either character by construction (parse only ever
 *   collects a segment already split on `&`, with any `#` already cut off
 *   into the hash); this throw exists for the same hand-built-input case
 *   `invalid-shell-subroute` guards against.
 * - `invalid-domain-key` — `value` (the offending key); `entry` set only
 *   when thrown by grammar serialize (FEATURE §3, Grammar Serialize, step
 *   2.1: "THROW an error naming this entry"), absent at every other throw
 *   site (observer creation, the back-projection helper, domain-key
 *   composition).
 * - `invalid-extension-token` — `value`; `entry` set only when thrown by
 *   grammar serialize, for the identical reason as above.
 * - `invalid-name` — `value`; thrown only by domain-key composition
 *   (FEATURE (navigation-substrate) §3, Domain-Key Composition, step 3).
 * - `invalid-param-name` — `entry`; a grammar-serialize input entry carried
 *   a param whose own name is the empty string — `param-name` requires at
 *   least one character (ADR 0003, "Tokens"), unlike `param-value`, which
 *   the identical production allows empty (FEATURE §3, Grammar Serialize,
 *   step 2.2).
 * - `duplicate-param-name` — `entry`; a grammar-serialize input entry
 *   carried two params of the identical name (FEATURE §3, Grammar
 *   Serialize, step 2.3).
 * - `duplicate-extension` — `entries`, a pair; a grammar-serialize input
 *   list carried two entries sharing the identical `domainKey` and
 *   `extension` (FEATURE §3, Grammar Serialize, step 2.4).
 * - `reordered-not-permutation` — `domainKey`, `reordered`; the URL
 *   back-projection helper's own `reordered` delta named a set of
 *   extension tokens that is not exactly the set of this domain key's own
 *   entries surviving the delta's other operations (added, removed,
 *   payload-changed, replaced) — a missing survivor, an extra token, or a
 *   duplicate. None of the other seven codes names this case: it is neither
 *   a lexical failure (`invalid-*`) nor a serialize-input shape violation
 *   (`duplicate-*`), so it is its own code.
 * - `no-navigation-history-in-realm` — no fields set; `resolveNavigationHistory`
 *   (`../history/singleton.js`) was called with no adapter override in a
 *   realm carrying no `window` at all (an SSR render, most commonly) — the
 *   one code this package throws from resolving the realm-shared singleton
 *   itself, rather than from a grammar/back-projection/observer input.

 *
 * `pageHash` is optional and governs the page hash the helper's single
 * history write carries, independent of the domain-key rewrite the other
 * three parameters describe (D2, review round 16-re): given (including
 * `''`), that value replaces whatever hash is currently in the URL —
 * `''` clears it, matching `serializeGrammar`'s own `hash !== ''` check
 * (`../grammar/serialize.js`); absent, the helper preserves the current
 * hash verbatim, the pre-existing behaviour. This keeps a page-hash write
 * inside the helper's own "exactly one write" guarantee instead of forcing
 * a caller to run its own parse → serialize → push sequence just to carry
 * a hash alongside a domain-key rewrite.
