// FEATURE (navigation-substrate) §3, Position Tracking
// (`cpt-frontx-algo-routing-navigation-substrate-position-tracking`) — the
// human ruling behind this file (F8/D3, review round 16-re): the position
// of the current entry belongs to the navigation substrate, not to any one
// engine-provider port's own ad hoc counter, because only the substrate
// itself sits on both sides of every write *and* every externally observed
// traversal (`popstate`) — a provider-local counter can only ever see the
// writes and traversals its own `push`/`go`/`back`/`forward` calls
// initiated, drifting from reality the moment a second router, a real
// back/forward gesture, or a third-party `history.go` moves the shared
// history without going through it.
//
// This is substrate bookkeeping, not entry-carried state in the sense
// `cpt-frontx-constraint-routing-no-engine-leak` forbids (`../types/index.js`,
// `Location.position` doc comment; FEATURE §1.5, "Entry-carried state — not
// part of this contract"): the only value this substrate ever writes into
// the host's own per-entry state is its own position number, under its own
// namespaced key, merged with whatever the host already carries there
// rather than replacing it outright.
