// FEATURE (navigation-substrate) §3, Realm-Global Singleton Resolution,
// Rationale: "The key carries the `NavigationHistory` contract's own
// version rather than naming the package alone, so a copy built against an
// incompatible future or past contract version resolves under its own key
// and constructs its own instance instead of silently capturing and
// reusing one whose shape it cannot actually satisfy." `v1` is this
// contract's current major — bumped only alongside a breaking change to the
// `NavigationHistory` shape itself, never for an additive change. It stays
// at `v1` until the package is first published; after that, any
// incompatible change to `NavigationHistory` or `Location` must bump it.
/** @internal Test seam — a conforming consumer never reads this key
 * directly; it is exported only so tests can reset the realm-global state
 * between cases without retyping the literal string in every suite. */

/**
 * Resolves the single `NavigationHistory` instance for the calling realm
 * and this contract version — freshly constructed on the first call,
 * reused on every later call from any independently bundled copy of this
 * package built against the same contract version (FEATURE §3,
 * Realm-Global Singleton Resolution).
 *
 * `createAdapter` is consulted only when no instance exists yet under this
 * realm's well-known key; a later caller's own `createAdapter` is ignored
 * once an instance is already stored, exactly as a second copy of this
 * package finds the first copy's instance already there. Defaults to the
 * browser `window` adapter; a test or an SSR entry point passes its own to
 * avoid touching `window` at all.
 *
 * @param createAdapter Test/SSR seam — a conforming consumer never passes
 * this; it exists so a test can resolve the singleton against a
 * `HistoryAdapter` double instead of `window`, and so an SSR entry point can
 * resolve it without ever touching `window`.
