/**
 * Constructs one `NavigationHistory` instance over `adapter`. Registers the
 * adapter's own pop subscription immediately, at construction — FEATURE §3,
 * Realm-Global Singleton Resolution, step 2.1: "not deferred until a first
 * caller subscribes ... so `location` is live from the instant this
 * instance exists, for a reader who never subscribes at all."
 *
 * This is the constructor `resolveNavigationHistory` (./singleton.ts) calls
 * at most once per realm and per contract version; a caller that needs its
 * own private instance (a test, most commonly) can call this directly.
 *
 * The adapter's own pop subscription registered below is never released —
 * intentional: a realm-global singleton lives for the lifetime of the realm
 * itself, so there is no teardown moment to release it at. A caller that
 * constructs its own private instance for a scope narrower than the whole
 * realm (a test, again the common case) is responsible for discarding that
 * instance itself; this function has no `dispose` because the one caller it
 * is actually designed for (`resolveNavigationHistory`) never needs one.
