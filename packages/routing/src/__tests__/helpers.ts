// Shared test scaffolding for `packages/routing`. Not part of the package's
// own public surface — imported only by files under `__tests__/`.

// DESIGN §3.3 public surface (N3, review round 16-re4; MEDIUM, review round
// 16-re5): the runtime values and the type-only names `src/index.ts`
// exports, pinned once here so `package.test.ts` (the runtime
// `import * as routing` pin) and `dist-internal.test.ts` (the built
// `dist/index.d.ts` presence/consumer checks) assert against the identical
// name list rather than two lists that could silently drift apart.
//
// MEDIUM (review round 16-re5): the runtime half used to be a hand-listed
// subset (5 of the 10 actual runtime exports) — a literal `@internal` in a
// `//` comment above `export { deriveExtensionToken, namesEqual,
// validateName }` (`../index.ts`) would have dropped all three from
// `dist/index.d.ts` with no test failing, exactly N3's own class of defect,
// because the hand list never claimed to cover them. It is now derived from
// `../index.js`'s own actual runtime exports (`Object.keys`, sorted) rather
// than maintained by hand, so a future export this package's own entry point
// adds or removes changes this list automatically instead of silently
// falling out of sync with it.
export const ROUTING_RUNTIME_SURFACE = Object.keys(routingIndex).sort();

// Type-only exports cannot be derived the same way — `export type *`/
// `export type { ... }` erase entirely at compile time, so there is no
// runtime object to call `Object.keys` on. This list is instead
// cross-checked by hand against every DESIGN §3.3 public-surface row that
// names a type rather than a function: the `NavigationHistory` contract
// (`NavigationHistory`, `Location`); the `resolveNavigationHistory`/
// `HistoryAdapter` seam (`HistoryAdapter`, `AdapterLocation`); the
// engine-provider port (`EngineProviderInput`, `EngineProviderPort`,
// `EntryAddress`); the registered-extensions source
// (`RegisteredExtensionsSource`); `createRouteSignal`'s own return shape
// (`RouteSignal`); the transition notification (`Transition`); and
// `RoutingError`'s own discriminant (`RoutingErrorCode`). Missing one of
// these here would silently reopen the same class of gap the runtime half
// above just closed — `helpers/surface-check.test.ts` proves the presence
// check this list feeds (`dist-internal.test.ts`) actually fails on a
// fixture missing a declared name, so an incomplete list is the only way
// left for a name to go unverified.
