## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

`@gears-frontx/routing` is the ecosystem's navigation library: the published library through which a composed application and its independently bundled microfrontends share one browser navigation history and keep the URL and the screen a user is looking at in agreement. It exposes a framework-agnostic navigation substrate carrying that shared history and the URL grammar codec, a resolution primitive that names which declared extension or extensions own a domain's entries at any depth of a composed application's own nesting of extension domains, and an engine-provider port so a concrete routing engine can be swapped inside a single microfrontend's own territory without touching the substrate, the host, or any sibling microfrontend. This library carries no dependency on any concrete router engine itself; a separately published engine-provider package satisfies the port, and the ecosystem provides a default implementation of it. This PRD owns the library's requirements; ecosystem-level requirements are owned by the [root PRD](../../../architecture/PRD.md).

### 1.2 Background / Problem Statement

A composed application is many independently bundled units running in one browser tab, each capable of owning some slice of the URL — and those units nest: a unit that owns one slice may itself contain further units, each owning its own slice beneath it, to whatever depth the composed application actually has. Left alone, each unit would create its own navigation history, so a programmatic navigation issued by one unit produces no change the others observe, and back/forward, deep links, and reloads stop agreeing with what is actually mounted at any depth. The Routing library gives every unit in the realm one navigation history to read and write, one uniform URL grammar every domain is addressed through regardless of depth or occupant count, and a signal — reported independently at every depth of that nesting, through each domain's own dedicated entries in the query string — of when the URL's resolved owner or owners change, from which the consumer keeps the mounted screen and the URL as two views of the same fact rather than two independent ones that can drift.

### 1.3 Goals (Business Outcomes)

- **Single navigation history across independently bundled units** — Target: exactly one navigation-history instance answers `push`/`replace`/`go`/`location`/`subscribe` for the host and every independently bundled microfrontend in the realm; Timeframe: first platform release.
- **URL is the single source of truth for which unit(s) occupy a routable placement** — Target: a cold load, a reload, and a back/forward step all resolve the same mounted occupant(s) from the URL through the same resolution path; Timeframe: first platform release.
- **Router engine swappable within one microfrontend's own territory** — Target: replacing the engine used by one microfrontend changes no file outside that microfrontend's own route tree, search-parameter handling, and its own imports of its provider package; Timeframe: first platform release.
- **Composition does not force every microfrontend onto one router-engine version** — Target: the navigation substrate itself declares no dependency on a concrete router engine; Timeframe: first platform release.

### 1.4 Glossary

This PRD uses the ecosystem's shared vocabulary: *application* means what the root glossary defines ([root PRD §1.4](../../../architecture/PRD.md#14-glossary)), and *microfrontend*, *extension*, and *extension domain* mean what the runtime's glossary defines ([mfes PRD §1.4](../../mfes/architecture/PRD.md#14-glossary)). The terms below are this library's own; the full grammar they summarize is normatively stated in this package's own Domain Occupancy Addressing Granularity decision record, which [DESIGN §1.1, URL Grammar](./DESIGN.md#1-architecture-overview) summarizes rather than restates.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| navigation substrate | The framework-agnostic core owning the single shared navigation history, the URL grammar codec, and the name-equality predicate and domain-key-composition function that codec is checked against and composed through; it depends on no router engine and no UI framework. Entry resolution itself is not this core's own algorithm — it is the route ownership signal's own primitive, built on this core's codec and predicate rather than re-implementing either. |
| engine provider | A separately published package that binds the navigation substrate's shared history to a concrete router engine so the engine can drive rendering and matching, by satisfying this library's engine-provider port. Not owned by this library: an engine provider's own requirements, behavior, and package boundary are owned by that provider's own PRD and DESIGN — the ecosystem's own default engine provider satisfies this same port. |
| zone | The territory an extension owns once mounted into an extension domain; a zone may itself contain further extension domains, so a composed application is a tree of domains and the zones their occupants open, to whatever depth the application actually composes. |
| level | One extension domain's own position in that tree, and the point at which this library resolves and reports ownership: resolution and observation both run against one domain at a time, never against the whole URL in one step, using only that domain's own domain key and that domain's own registered routable extensions. |
| shell subroute | Everything in the URL between the first `/` and `?` — the pathname. Owned entirely by the shell (the host application); this library never interprets it and copies it verbatim on every write. A shell subroute that names nothing is `/`; a nested domain's own state never continues it. A URL where no domain projects any entry at all is the shell subroute alone, with no trailing `?` — for example `/en` — and is itself a valid, fully resolved state, not a partial or broken one: every projected domain is simply empty. |
| domain key | The value every one of a domain's own entries shares as their query-string key: a bare, locally-chosen `name` for a domain at the tree's root, assigned by the host, or a composite `parent-key.parent-extension.name` for a domain nested inside an extension's own zone, composed by this package from three parts the enclosing level supplies the moment the nested domain begins to exist. A domain key is fixed for the observer created with it and never updated on a live observer: replacing it means the enclosing level releases the observer holding the old value and creates its successor carrying the new one. |
| entry | One `domain-key=extension;param;param=value;...` construct in the query string, contributed once per occupant of a domain: a domain with N occupants contributes N entries sharing its own domain key. Written by this package from the fact of occupancy; the parameters after the extension are the occupant's own. |
| entry address | The domain key and extension token that together name one entry — `{domainKey, extension}` — assigned to an occupant by the enclosing level the moment it mounts that occupant, or absent entirely when the occupant runs standalone. This is the value the engine-provider port hands a conforming provider as its own construction input (§7; DESIGN §3.3, Engine-provider port); it is not itself an entry's own payload. |
| payload | The parameters an entry carries beyond the fact of occupancy — encoded as ordered `key=value` pairs joined by matrix-style `;` separators — the occupant's own, never interpreted by this library's own resolution. |
| extension token | The `name`-alphabet value an entry's own extension segment carries: a caller-supplied identity value that must satisfy this package's own `name` lexical rule, normalized by stripping one leading `/` before that check. This glossary does not fix where that value originates; a composed deployment typically sources it from the extension registration's own declared routable identity, a field the `mfes` package's own contract declares, not one this glossary defines. A value that is not a valid `name` after normalization, or that is absent entirely, is not routable and is never projected. |
| route owner | The identity of whichever extension currently occupies one entry — identically the entry's own extension token, paired with the fact of that occupancy; supplied to the navigation substrate by that domain's own level as part of its own registered-extensions source. Two mounts of the identical underlying extension are two distinct route owners, each its own independently registered extension token, never one route owner declaring two entries. |
| occupant | Every route owner this PRD already defines is also an occupant: an occupant is a route owner that additionally carries its own payload, addressable independently once more than one occupant exists in the same domain at once (§5.2). |
| occupancy strategy | The rule that governs how many occupants a domain may hold mounted at once: exactly one, for every domain this PRD describes outside §5.2, or several concurrently, for a domain a concurrent occupancy strategy governs (§5.2). |
| route ownership signal | The observable signal this library publishes, independently at every domain, when that domain's own resolved entries change — an owner appearing, disappearing, changing, its own payload changing, or the entry order changing — together with the URL back-projection helper a consumer calls after a mount not driven by navigation, which replaces that domain's own entries and removes the subtree entries of anything the change removes or supersedes. Two-way agreement between the URL and which unit is actually mounted, at any level, is not this library's own guarantee; it is the consumer's, built on top of this signal (§11). |

## 2. Actors

### 2.1 Human Actors

#### Application Developer

**ID**: `cpt-frontx-routing-actor-application-developer`

**Role**: Mounts the navigation substrate at the host application, creates the route ownership signal's observer for the host's own domain level with its own source of declared registered extensions, and wires the host's own router to the shared history; the same role recurs one domain level deeper whenever a mounted extension's own zone contains a further domain, with that extension's own consumer creating that level's own observer. Fills the root PRD's Project Developer role (`cpt-frontx-actor-project-developer`) at the navigation surface.
**Needs**: A single history usable from the host and from every independently bundled microfrontend, one uniform grammar for binding a domain's entries to whichever units currently occupy it at any domain level, no obligation to standardize every microfrontend on one router-engine version, and — for a domain whose own occupancy strategy admits more than one occupant at once — every concurrently mounted occupant staying independently addressable in the URL.

#### Microfrontend Developer

**ID**: `cpt-frontx-routing-actor-microfrontend-developer`

**Role**: Builds a microfrontend's own router scoped to its own entry — the domain key and extension token it was mounted at — an application- or deployment-supplied address unrelated to the shell subroute. The extension declares its own route in its own registered declaration, not in this library's own contract; the enclosing level assigns the domain its own domain key, and through it the entry the extension's own extension token composes, the moment it mounts that extension — the host is that enclosing level for a microfrontend mounted at the outermost domain, and the deployment supplies the microfrontend's own virtual location directly when the same microfrontend is served on its own. Fills the root PRD's Template Developer role (`cpt-frontx-actor-template-developer`) where a template contributes a microfrontend.
**Needs**: A stable entry-address contract, freedom to choose or swap the router engine inside the microfrontend's own territory, a documented way to navigate outside that territory when the microfrontend legitimately needs to, and — when the same microfrontend entry is mounted more than once in one domain at once — each of those instances, and its own live payload, staying independently addressable rather than conflated with the other.

### 2.2 System Actors

#### Router Engine

**ID**: `cpt-frontx-routing-actor-router-engine`

**Role**: The pluggable, replaceable engine an engine-provider package binds the shared navigation history to, through this library's engine-provider port. Treated as opaque and substitutable by the navigation substrate and by every microfrontend other than the one that chose it; this library carries no concrete engine dependency of its own and no opinion on which engine a provider package chooses.

## 3. Operational Concept & Environment

The host application mounts the navigation substrate once per realm and creates the route ownership signal's observer for its own domain level, supplying its own source of declared registered extensions as a plain argument; the substrate exposes the shared history to the host's own router and to every microfrontend an engine provider mounts at its own entry. Every navigation — a link click, a back/forward step, a cold load, a reload, an imperative call — is read from or written to the one shared history, and the route ownership signal reports the resulting ownership transition to whichever level's own consumer created that level's observer; that consumer mounts or unmounts through its own mount mechanism and keeps the URL and the mounted route owner in agreement by acting on that signal and calling the URL back-projection helper when it mounts for a reason other than navigation — this library publishes the signal and takes no part in deciding when a mount or unmount actually happens, including after the application has already booted (see this package's own Mount Trigger Ownership decision record for which channel drives a mount at that point). The same recurs one domain level deeper whenever a mounted extension's own zone contains a further domain: that extension's own consumer creates the deeper level's own observer, supplying that domain's own registered extensions, and resolves that level's own entries exactly as the host resolved its own.

The same microfrontend runs under two deployment modes without a change to its routing code. **Composed**: the host mounts the substrate, creates the route ownership signal's observer, and hands each nested domain the domain key this package composes from the enclosing occupant's own entry. **Standalone**: the microfrontend is served on its own, no observer is required, and its own virtual location is projected directly onto the page's own pathname and search by its own engine-provider package, with no entry address at all. The substrate and the engine provider behave identically in both; only whether an observer exists, and where the virtual location comes from, differs, and nothing in standalone operation depends on an observer not existing.

### 3.1 Module-Specific Environment Constraints

- Requires a browser environment with a navigation-history API for the substrate's own realm-shared instance.
- Requires a single JavaScript realm shared by the host and every independently bundled microfrontend: the navigation substrate's single-shared-history guarantee is a realm-scoped property, not a per-bundle one.
- The router engine is never a dependency of the navigation substrate itself: every engine-specific dependency is confined to whichever separately published engine-provider package implements this library's engine-provider port (`cpt-frontx-routing-fr-engine-provider-port`).
- Standalone by construction: no intra-ecosystem package dependency; the binding to route owners is expressed only through a consumer-supplied registered-extensions source, passed as a plain argument, and the binding to mounting only through the observable signal this library publishes — never through an import of the runtime that manages either one. The composed and standalone modes differ only in whether a route-ownership-signal observer is created and in where a microfrontend's virtual location comes from, not in any port supplied to the package.
- Third-party code on the page may call the browser's own navigation-history API directly, bypassing the shared navigation history. This is an environmental condition the library does not prevent, not a supported way to navigate: a call that bypasses the shared instance leaves its `location` stale and its fan-out silent for that change (see DESIGN §4 failure modes).
- **Locale prefix ownership**: the shell subroute segment carrying the active locale (for example a leading `/en`) is owned by the shell alone; the navigation substrate and the URL back-projection helper copy it forward verbatim and never interpret it. A locale change the shell makes by rewriting that segment through the one realm-shared navigation history — a `push` or `replace`, exactly like any other navigation — is observed by every occupant exactly as any other navigation is, because every occupant reads that same shared history; every occupant's own entries are preserved by construction across that rewrite, since they live in the query string under their own domain keys, never inside the shell subroute segment being rewritten. A locale change the shell makes outside the shared history is the same unsupported, environment-level condition the bullet above already documents for any third-party bypass of the shared instance, not a locale-specific gap: this library makes no promise about what an occupant observes when the URL changes through a channel it does not read.
- **URL length budget**: the composed URL — the shell subroute, the hash, and every domain's own entries together — SHOULD stay under 2000 characters, the widely cited de facto ceiling for compatibility across browsers and the proxies and load balancers many deployments sit behind, rather than any single browser's own documented limit. This budget is guidance for the shell and every occupant to keep in mind as they decide how much they put into their own entries, not a limit the URL back-projection helper enforces: the helper imposes no length limit of its own and performs no truncation, and writes exactly the URL a consumer's own back-projection call asked for. Staying under the budget, and deciding what to do when a composed URL would exceed it, is the consumer's own responsibility.
- **Reload and server-side rewrite**: a full reload and a server-side rewrite that lands the browser on the shell's own entry point **MUST** resolve to the identical mounted state a client-side navigation to that same URL would have produced — every occupant's own state reconstructs from the URL alone, through the same per-domain resolution path an ordinary navigation uses (`cpt-frontx-routing-fr-route-ownership-signal`); a cold mount is not a degraded case this library resolves differently from any other. Producing that URL in the first place — rendering the mounted screens on the server, or generating the rewritten URL itself — is out of scope for this library (§4.2): the guarantee here is that whatever URL the browser ends up presenting on that first paint resolves exactly as it would on any later navigation, not that this library renders anything for that first response.

## 4. Scope

### 4.1 In Scope

- A single, realm-shared navigation history with fan-out subscription: one real subscription to the browser's navigation history, redistributed to every listener.
- Imperative navigation outside the UI tree: `push`, `replace`, `go`, `location`, `subscribe` against the shared history.
- The URL grammar — one uniform entry construct addressing every domain at any depth and any occupant count — and the engine-provider port a separately published provider package implements against it.
- The route ownership signal: resolving, at each domain, the entries carrying that domain's own domain key to that domain's own declared route owners, observing and reporting every ownership-relevant transition at that level to the consumer, and a URL back-projection helper the consumer calls after a mount not driven by navigation — the two-way agreement between the URL and a mounted owner is the consumer's own guarantee, built on this signal (§11).
- Concurrent occupant projection and per-occupant addressable parameters: for a domain whose own occupancy strategy admits more than one occupant mounted side by side at once, projecting every concurrently mounted occupant into the URL and keeping each one's own parameters independently addressable and resolvable back to the specific occupant that produced them (§5.2).
- The channel boundary: this library owns the URL channel only, among the ecosystem's host–microfrontend communication channels.

### 4.2 Out of Scope

- Addressed action dispatch and shared-property broadcast between microfrontends and the host — owned by the runtime that provides those channels ([mfes PRD](../../mfes/architecture/PRD.md)); this library neither duplicates nor mediates either one.
- Microfrontend loading, admission, placement, and isolation — owned by the runtime ([mfes PRD](../../mfes/architecture/PRD.md)).
- The registry of route owners, the execution of a mount, and any reconciliation between a competing pair of mounts — all owned by the consumer's own mount mechanism at every domain level, reached only through the plain-argument registered-extensions source and the observable signal this library publishes, never through an injected port or an import of the runtime that implements them.
- Any router-engine implementation, and any provider-side concern — router construction, deployment-mode parity for a microfrontend's own routing code, and location-preserving navigation helpers — all owned entirely by whichever separately published engine-provider package a microfrontend depends on, including the ecosystem's own default engine-provider package.

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Navigation Coordination

#### Single navigation substrate shared across independently bundled units

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-routing-fr-single-navigation-substrate`

The system **MUST** expose exactly one navigation-history instance per realm, reachable by the host and by every independently bundled microfrontend, and **MUST** fan out one underlying browser-history subscription to every listener that subscribes to it.

**Rationale**: Independently bundled units cannot share a compile-time singleton; a realm-shared instance is what keeps `push`/`replace`/`go` and back/forward consistent for every unit without requiring them to coordinate with each other directly.

**Actors**: `cpt-frontx-routing-actor-application-developer`, `cpt-frontx-routing-actor-microfrontend-developer`

#### Engine provider port

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-routing-fr-engine-provider-port`

The system **MUST** expose the shared navigation history to a router engine only through a pluggable engine-provider port, satisfied by a separately published provider package, and **MUST** let a microfrontend replace its provider package with a different one without changing the navigation substrate, the URL grammar, the host, or any sibling microfrontend. The port describes only what a provider **MUST** accept from the substrate — the shared `NavigationHistory` instance, the entry address this occupant was mounted at (its own domain key and extension token), or its absence when the occupant runs standalone, and an opaque route tree — and that a provider is responsible for producing a constructed, mounted router from them; it names no concrete engine.

**Rationale**: Concrete router engines evolve independently of the substrate; confining engine choice to a swappable, separately published provider package is what keeps that evolution from reaching outside the microfrontend that made the choice, and what keeps the substrate itself free of any concrete engine dependency.

**Actors**: `cpt-frontx-routing-actor-microfrontend-developer`

#### Route ownership signal

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-routing-fr-route-ownership-signal`

The system **MUST** resolve, at each domain independently, every entry currently carrying that domain's own domain key to that domain's own declared route owner by matching the entry's own extension token against the domain's own registered routable extensions — a nested domain's own domain key composed by this package from the enclosing entry's own domain key, the enclosing entry's own extension token, and the nested domain's own locally-chosen name, never from a segment of the shell subroute — and **MUST** publish an observable signal, per domain, reporting every ownership-relevant transition at that domain to a consumer that supplies its own set of declared registered extensions for that domain as a plain argument: an owner appearing, disappearing, changing, its own payload changing, or the entry order changing. The system **MUST** also provide a URL back-projection helper the consumer calls to reflect a mount that was not driven by navigation back into the URL under that domain's own entries — rewriting only the entries the caller's own delta names as added, removed, payload-changed, replaced, or reordered, leaving every entry under that domain key the delta does not name in its existing position, and removing every entry whose own domain key begins with a removed or replaced entry's domain key extended by its own (or, for a replaced entry, its prior) extension and a further path segment (structural reset) — with the history verb left to the caller: opening an occupant outside navigation is projected with `push`, closing one with `replace`; when the mount being reflected changes one domain's own occupancy, that reflection **MUST NOT** silently discard any sibling domain's own entries already projected in the URL. Two-way agreement between the URL and which unit is actually mounted, at any level, is the consumer's own guarantee, built on top of this signal and this helper — not a guarantee this library makes on its own (§11).

**Rationale**: Treating the URL as the single source of truth for occupancy at every domain — not only the outermost one — and publishing that fact as an observable signal per domain rather than orchestrating mounting itself, is what lets a deep link into a nested domain, a reload, and a back/forward step all resolve to the same declared owner an ordinary click-driven navigation would reach, one domain at a time, as each domain comes to exist. Because this library holds no registry of domains, it publishes no signal asserting that a deep address resolved end to end; only each domain's own local transition, which the consumer's own mount mechanism composes across domains into whatever end-to-end fact it needs. Giving every domain its own dedicated entries under its own domain key, rather than sharing any single URL segment with a sibling domain, is what lets any number of domains — and, within one domain, any number of occupants — project into the URL at once without one ever displacing another's own address.

**Actors**: `cpt-frontx-routing-actor-application-developer`, `cpt-frontx-routing-actor-microfrontend-developer`

#### Imperative navigation outside the UI tree

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-routing-fr-imperative-navigation`

The system **MUST** expose `push`, `replace`, `go`, `location`, and `subscribe` against the shared navigation history for use outside any UI component tree.

**Rationale**: Not every caller that needs to read or change the URL is a rendered component; a mounting resolver, a host action handler, or a bootstrapping routine needs the same navigation surface without needing a mounted router to reach it.

**Actors**: `cpt-frontx-routing-actor-application-developer`, `cpt-frontx-routing-actor-microfrontend-developer`

### 5.2 Concurrent Occupant Projection

A domain's own occupancy strategy may hold more than one occupant mounted side by side at once rather than exactly one — for example two occupants of the same kind mounted concurrently (two instances of the same extension, each with its own live parameters) alongside a third occupant of a different kind, all within the same domain. The worked case evaluated against this pair of requirements is three peer root domains, none nested inside another: a `screen` domain holding a single occupant, addressed by the same construct as every other domain in the tree; a `sheet` domain governed by a concurrent occupancy strategy that holds two occupants concurrently; and a `widgets` domain, also governed by a concurrent occupancy strategy, that holds three occupants concurrently — two of them separate instances of the very same microfrontend entry, each with its own live parameter value, alongside a third occupant of a different kind. What must hold true for this tree: every one of the `widgets` domain's three concurrent occupants, and both of the `sheet` domain's occupants, is projected into the URL; each occupant — including each of the two same-entry instances — stays independently addressable; and each same-entry instance's own live parameter value resolves back to that specific instance and never to the other, so neither instance's parameter is ever conflated with or overwritten by the other's. This PRD requires only that such a domain's concurrent occupants each get projected and each stay independently addressable, including the two same-entry instances remaining individually resolvable; the exact grammar by which a domain's own contribution to the URL is assembled is DESIGN's own concern, stated normatively in this package's own URL Grammar (DESIGN §1.1).

The tree this requirement is evaluated against, in outline — three peer root domains, none nested inside another:

```
screen domain (1 occupant)
sheet domain, concurrent occupancy (2 occupants)
widgets domain, concurrent occupancy (3 occupants: two same-entry instances + one of a different kind)
```

Concretely, using this package's own grammar, one instance of this tree resolves to:

```
/en?screen=dashboard;orientation=left
   &sheet=tenant-details;tenantId=456
   &sheet=user-contacts;contactId=123;view=active
   &widgets=line-a;range=7d
   &widgets=line-b;range=30d
   &widgets=pie;metric=revenue
```

`sheet` and `widgets` are peer root domains, exactly like `screen`, not nested inside it or each other: `sheet` holds two occupants, and `widgets` holds three, two of them (`line-a`, `line-b`) separate instances of the identical microfrontend entry, each with its own `range` value resolving back to that instance alone. An implementation **MUST** reproduce this example as one of its own acceptance scenarios.

This worked scenario is evaluated as a structural invariant on a fixed tree — every occupant projected and addressable — rather than as a sequence of steps with branching alternatives; a formal Use Case (§8), built around a main flow and alternative flows, would add flow-structure this requirement does not have without adding a fact this PRD does not already state, so this outline stands in place of one.

#### Concurrent occupant projection

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-routing-fr-concurrent-occupant-projection`

For a domain whose own occupancy strategy admits more than one occupant mounted side by side at once, the system **MUST** project every one of those concurrently mounted occupants into the URL as its own entry sharing that domain's own domain key, and **MUST** resolve and report each one's own transition through the route ownership signal independently of the others, at the same domain. This requirement extends, and does not weaken, the existing per-domain-key extension-token uniqueness guarantee (§11) for a domain whose own occupancy strategy admits only one occupant at a time.

**Rationale**: Today's route ownership signal reports occupancy for a domain's own single resolved owner; a domain governed by a concurrent occupancy strategy has, by construction, more than one. Leaving such a domain unprojected means every one of its concurrent occupants — that they are mounted at all, and each one's own live parameters — has no representation in the URL at all, defeating the URL-as-source-of-truth goal (§1.3) for exactly the domains where it is admitted to matter most.

**Actors**: `cpt-frontx-routing-actor-application-developer`, `cpt-frontx-routing-actor-microfrontend-developer`

#### Per-occupant addressable parameters

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-routing-fr-per-occupant-addressable-parameters`

For a domain projected under `cpt-frontx-routing-fr-concurrent-occupant-projection`, the system **MUST** keep each concurrently mounted occupant's own parameters addressable and resolvable back to the specific occupant that produced them, by carrying them inside that occupant's own entry as matrix-style `;key=value` pairs, without requiring every occupant's own parameters to share one flat query-string namespace in which two occupants' own parameter names could collide.

**Rationale**: A flat query string gives every occupant of a domain the same namespace for its own parameters; two occupants that each name their own parameter identically — including, most plainly, two occupants that are both instances of the same underlying extension and therefore name their own parameter the same way by construction, not by coincidence — would otherwise silently collide or overwrite one another rather than each staying independently addressable and bookmarkable.

**Actors**: `cpt-frontx-routing-actor-application-developer`, `cpt-frontx-routing-actor-microfrontend-developer`

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

### 6.1 NFR Inclusions

#### Standalone Package Boundary

- [ ] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-routing-nfr-standalone`

The system **MUST** import no other package in this ecosystem, and **MUST** call no consumer of its own: the source of declared registered extensions reaches the system only as a plain argument supplied by the consumer, and the system never itself invokes a mounting operation — mounting is performed by the consumer, acting on the system's published signal.

**Threshold**: Zero intra-ecosystem edges in the package manifest, and zero intra-ecosystem edges in the import graph, both verified mechanically by the boundary guards.

**Rationale**: This is the membership property the package claims in the published-libraries layer, and what lets an application adopt shared navigation while using none of the rest of the ecosystem.

#### Agnostic Navigation Core

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-routing-nfr-agnostic-core`

The navigation substrate **MUST** carry no dependency on any router engine or UI framework whatsoever; every dependency on a concrete engine **MUST** live in a separately published engine-provider package that implements the engine-provider port, never inside this package.

**Threshold**: This package's own module carries zero import of any router engine or of a UI-framework rendering primitive; checked mechanically by the boundary guards as a package-boundary property — no engine or UI-framework package can appear in this package's manifest or import graph at all, not merely inside a designated internal component.

**Rationale**: Keeping the substrate free of engine or framework knowledge is what lets one microfrontend's routing table change engines, or lets the default engine-provider package itself be replaced ecosystem-wide, without the substrate, the host, or any other microfrontend noticing. Making this a package boundary rather than an intra-package convention is what turns "confined to one component" into "absent from this package's own dependency graph, mechanically checkable without inspecting which module inside the package a given import lives in."

### 6.2 NFR Exclusions

The root PRD's §6.2 exclusions (safety, privacy, accessibility, internationalization, inclusivity, regulatory compliance) apply here for the same reasons stated there.

## 7. Public Library Interfaces

### 7.1 Public API Surface

The package's public surface is specified by this package's [DESIGN](./DESIGN.md) §3.3 and by its FEATUREs.

### 7.2 External Integration Contracts

None owned here. The package is distributed under the root PRD's package-registry distribution contract (`cpt-frontx-contract-package-registry-distribution`). The mapping from a route owner's identifier to the concrete unit it names, and the execution of a mount, are the consumer's own contracts, reached only through the plain-argument registered-extensions source and the observable signal this package publishes — never products this package publishes itself.

## 8. Use Cases

#### Deep link resolves to a not-yet-mounted extension's screen, level by level

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-routing-usecase-deep-link-to-microfrontend-screen`

**Actor**: `cpt-frontx-routing-actor-application-developer`

**Preconditions**:
- The navigation substrate is mounted at the host, and the host has created the route ownership signal's observer for the host's own domain, supplying its own source of declared registered extensions.
- A URL naming a route owner several domains deep is opened cold, reloaded, or reached by back/forward, and none of the extensions along that path are yet mounted.

**Main Flow**:
1. The host's own domain-level observer reads every entry carrying its own domain key, resolves each one to a declared route owner by matching its extension token against the host's own registered extensions, and reports the owner appearing (`cpt-frontx-routing-fr-route-ownership-signal`); the observer supplies only those entries and the host's own declared registered extensions to the resolution primitive itself, never performing the matching directly.
2. The host's own mount mechanism mounts that route owner in response to the reported transition.
3. Once mounted, that extension's own zone may itself contain a further domain; for each such domain that comes to exist, its own consumer creates that level's own observer, which resolves the entries carrying the domain key composed for it from the mounted extension's own entry against that domain's own registered extensions, exactly as the host's own level did, and reports its own transition.
4. This repeats one domain level deeper each time a resolved owner's own zone contains a further domain that has come to exist, until every domain along the URL's path has resolved, or until a domain resolves to no owner.
5. At every domain, once its own owner is mounted, that extension's own engine-provider package reads the current location from the shared history at start and reads its own entry's own payload as its own route and search — a guarantee the engine-provider port's consumer, not this library, makes about its own construction (owned by that provider's own PRD).

**Postconditions**:
- Each mounted extension and the entry its own domain resolved agree without a blank screen, because each freshly mounted router reads the already-current location rather than starting from a blank route. This library never asserts that every domain along the path resolved together as one event — only that each domain resolved from a location already current the moment that domain began observing.

**Alternative Flows**:
- **No declared owner matches an entry at a domain**: that domain's own observer reports the entry as unresolved; the consumer holding that domain shows its own fallback and mounts nothing beneath it. A domain several steps deeper along the same URL reporting nothing is indistinguishable, at any shallower domain's own observer, from that deeper domain's own wave simply not having arrived yet, since no domain's own signal ever asserts that an address resolved beyond that domain's own entries.
- **The URL later drops or changes a mounted owner's entry at some domain**: that domain's own observer reports the owner disappearing or changing, and the consumer holding that domain unmounts through its own mount mechanism. A navigation issued while several domains are still resolving is safe: the resolution restarts as a fresh wave from the outermost domain, every stale domain is torn down by whichever domain mounted it, and no domain ever holds onto state of its own — every domain always reads the shared history's current location.

## 9. Acceptance Criteria

- [x] A single navigation-history instance answers `push`/`replace`/`go`/`location`/`subscribe` for the host and for every independently bundled microfrontend registered in the same realm, and every one of those five members is callable by a caller with no mounted router or UI-framework component tree in its call path — verifiable via `cpt-frontx-routing-fr-single-navigation-substrate` and `cpt-frontx-routing-fr-imperative-navigation`.
- [ ] Replacing the engine-provider package used by one microfrontend changes no file outside that microfrontend's own route tree, search-parameter handling, and its own imports of its provider package — verifiable via `cpt-frontx-routing-fr-engine-provider-port`.
- [ ] A cold load, a reload, and a back/forward step all resolve the same declared route owner from a domain's own entries through the same resolution path, at every domain a consumer holds an observer for, reported as an observable transition to that domain's own consumer — verifiable via `cpt-frontx-routing-fr-route-ownership-signal`.
- [ ] For a domain whose own occupancy strategy admits more than one occupant at once, every concurrently mounted occupant is projected into the URL and its own transition is reported independently through the route ownership signal — verifiable via `cpt-frontx-routing-fr-concurrent-occupant-projection`.
- [ ] Each concurrently mounted occupant's own parameters resolve back to the specific occupant that produced them, with no collision between two occupants' own parameter names — verifiable via `cpt-frontx-routing-fr-per-occupant-addressable-parameters`.
- [ ] The following two examples resolve, round-trip, and are restorable from a cold load exactly as pictured; an implementation **MUST** reproduce both as its own acceptance scenarios.

  **Reference link** — a `screen` domain holding one occupant with its own parameter, a `sheet` domain holding two occupants at once (one of them with two parameters), and a `widgets` domain holding three occupants at once, two of them separate instances of the identical microfrontend entry:

  ```
  /en?screen=dashboard;orientation=left
     &sheet=tenant-details;tenantId=456
     &sheet=user-contacts;contactId=123;view=active
     &widgets=line-a;range=7d
     &widgets=line-b;range=30d
     &widgets=pie;metric=revenue
  ```

  **Console layout** — a Tenants screen showing tenant `ABC`, its own `tabs` domain nested inside that screen's own zone on the Contacts tab, and a create-contact modal in the console's own root `modal` domain:

  ```
  /en?screen=tenants;tenantId=ABC
     &screen.tenants.tabs=contacts
     &modal=create-contact
  ```

  `screen.tenants.tabs` is composite because the tabs domain lives inside the `tenants` extension's zone; `modal` is bare because the console declared it at the root.
- [ ] The package declares no intra-ecosystem dependency, and its navigation substrate carries no import of any router engine or a UI framework — verifiable via the boundary guards.

| Browser navigation-history API | The primitive the substrate's own realm-shared history implementation is built on. | p1 |

## 11. Assumptions

- The host and every independently bundled microfrontend composed into one application share a single JavaScript realm; the navigation substrate's sharing boundary is the realm.
- The host mounts the navigation substrate, and creates the route ownership signal's observer for its own domain with its own registered-extensions source, before any deep link into any domain's screen is resolved; a nested domain's own consumer does the same for its own domain, once that domain begins to exist.
- Which extension registrations are routable at all, and under which extension token, is decided by the runtime's own registration contract, not by this library: an extension's own declared route-identity value — a field the `mfes` package's own contract declares, not one this library's own schema defines — normalized by stripping one leading `/`, is what this library reads as that extension's own extension token; a registration whose normalized value is not a valid `name`, or that supplies none at all, is not routable and is never projected.
- A same-domain conflict — two route owners registering the identical extension token at the same domain — is caught at the point that domain's own consumer registers its route owners, not by this library; extension-token equality for this purpose is decided by this library's own name-equality predicate, published precisely so a domain's own consumer can apply the same rule the library itself uses to resolve either token at navigation time. Nesting a further domain inside one route owner's own zone is not a same-domain conflict: it is a separate domain, one level deeper, with its own independent set of route owners and its own independent conflict check.
- This check compares distinct registrations against one another, so it catches two separately registered route owners that declare the same extension token — including two mounts of the identical underlying extension, since each mount is its own distinct route owner with its own independently declared token, never one route owner or one registration shared between them. There is no case this check cannot see: a same-entry mount declaring the same token as another occupant is caught exactly as any other pair of route owners declaring the same token is.
- A root domain's own name is the host's own single choice for each domain it projects — target state: a `route` field on the domain's own registration, owned by the `mfes` runtime; transitional state, until that field exists: a host-side table from domain id to name. Either way, this library treats the name as a plain argument the host supplies, never as a value it derives.
- A route owner's own extension token is one `name`-alphabet value: the registered-extensions source a domain's own consumer supplies is a set of route owners, but no identity appears in it against two different tokens. The same underlying extension mounted more than once — to present the same UI at more than one place — is a distinct route owner at each mount, each with its own independently declared token, never one route owner declaring several; an ownership-change transition therefore never needs to carry more than the new owner's own current token, since that token is fixed for as long as the registration producing it exists.
- This guarantee disambiguates identity-to-token mapping only; it does not by itself bound how many declared tokens' own route owners one domain may report as concurrently resolved at once. A domain whose own occupancy strategy admits only one occupant at a time still has exactly one resolved owner per token, as this bullet states; a domain whose own occupancy strategy admits several occupants side by side reports each concurrently resolved owner independently, without weakening this same per-token guarantee for any one of them (`cpt-frontx-routing-fr-concurrent-occupant-projection`, §5.2).
- A microfrontend declares the routes in its own routing table relative to its own entry, never as an absolute location carrying a shell subroute or another domain's own entries. Reaching outside that entry — an absolute location, an addressed action to the host — is always a deliberate act through a channel of its own, never a routing-table reach.
- Entry order in the query string is preserved on read and on write and carries no meaning this library assigns; a domain that needs an order of its own (a stack of sheets, a widget layout) reads it from the ordered entry list this library hands it, rather than from any semantics this library attaches to position.
- A consumer that needs the URL and the mounted route owner to durably agree, at any domain, implements that reconciliation itself at that domain, on top of the route ownership signal and the URL back-projection helper that domain's own observer publishes (`cpt-frontx-routing-fr-route-ownership-signal`); this library publishes the facts the reconciliation acts on but does not perform the reconciliation itself, at the outermost domain or at any domain nested beneath it — a domain several levels deep carries exactly the same obligation as the outermost one, never a lesser or different one. Which channel is permitted to drive that reconciliation's own mount or unmount once the application has already booted is decided outside this library, by whichever mount mechanism the consumer's runtime already owns, per this package's own Mount Trigger Ownership decision record; this library's own contribution stops at the signal and the helper, at cold load exactly as at every later transition.
- More than one route-ownership-signal observer may exist in the same realm at once — one per domain a consumer holds — with no conflict between them: each observer is independent, reads its own registered-extensions source, resolves against its own domain key's own entries, and reports its own transitions against the one shared navigation history every observer in the realm reads. Resolving a URL several domains deep is therefore not one event but a wave of independent, per-domain resolutions: each domain's own observer resolves and reports the moment that domain begins to exist, this library holds no registry of domains and so publishes no signal asserting that an address resolved end to end, and a domain several steps deeper reporting nothing yet is indistinguishable, at any shallower domain, from that deeper domain's own wave simply not having arrived — until the deeper domain itself begins to exist and reports its own first resolution. This wave describes one domain's own multiplicity across depth; several occupants sharing the same domain at the same depth is a distinct multiplicity, addressed by this library's own concurrent-occupant requirements rather than by this bullet (§5.2).
- **Same-entry mounts are ordinary distinct route owners, not a shared-registration gap**: `cpt-frontx-routing-fr-concurrent-occupant-projection` (§5.2) requires two concurrently mounted instances of the identical underlying extension to stay independently addressable within one domain. This already holds by construction: an extension is an instance, and each mount is its own separately registered route owner with its own independently declared extension token — never one route owner or one registration two mounts share. Two same-entry mounts that happened to declare the same token would therefore be caught by the ordinary registration-time conflict check, above, exactly as any other pair of route owners declaring the same token is; there is no special same-entry case, no missing discriminator to mint, and no gap for another package's requirements to close.
- **Decided at provider level, outside this PRD — an occupant's own internal routing state alongside domain-occupancy addressing**: this PRD requires each concurrently mounted occupant of a domain to stay independently addressable, with its own parameters resolving back to it alone (§5.2). How an occupant's own internal navigation state — whatever screen or view that occupant itself is currently showing inside its own zone — coexists with that addressing, once the occupant is one of several mounted side by side rather than a domain's sole occupant, is not decided by this PRD: the ecosystem's own default engine provider reserves the payload parameter `route` for that purpose, a convention that provider adopts, not a rule this package or this PRD imposes (DESIGN §1.1, Navigation Substrate).

## 12. Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Two independently bundled copies of this package end up with two separate history instances instead of one shared instance. | Programmatic navigation in one copy produces no change the other observes, so routers drift out of agreement with each other and with the URL. | The navigation substrate is reached through a single realm-shared instance rather than a per-bundle one, by construction, for every copy built against the same `NavigationHistory` contract version. This prevention holds within one contract version only: a copy built against a different version resolves under its own versioned key and constructs its own instance, so a cross-version mismatch yields one instance per version rather than a single shared one. |
| A replacement router engine's history adapter does not fully satisfy the shared history's contract. | The microfrontend that adopted it may navigate correctly in isolation while disagreeing with the rest of the realm. | The engine-provider port states the history contract the substrate expects; the engine-behind-port constraint keeps every other unit unaffected by the substitution either way. |
| A bookmark or deep link carries an entry whose extension token was retired, or that predates a registration-set change. | The domain that would have resolved it reports the entry as unresolved rather than restoring the state the user expected; nothing in this library distinguishes "stale" from "not yet registered." | Reported as unresolved and left in place, never silently dropped, so a host-level policy can detect and clean it up on its own terms (§1.1, URL Grammar). |
| A payload value's own party builds its own query-string handling on `URLSearchParams` instead of this library's own codec. | `URLSearchParams` encodes `;` and `=` itself, so a value written through it would double-encode this grammar's own delimiters and corrupt neighbouring entries. | The grammar codec this package publishes is its own parser and serializer, never an adapter over `URLSearchParams`; every party reading or writing a payload value goes through this package's own API instead. |
