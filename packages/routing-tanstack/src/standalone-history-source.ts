// steps 1, 1.1, 1.2).
//
// Design decision (task 10): `readParams` reuses
// `projectVirtualLocationToParams` — the same pure function
// `createComposedVirtualLocationSource`'s own write path uses to turn a
// virtual location back into a parameter list — to build a params array
// from the page's own current pathname/search. Feeding that array back
// through `projectParamsToVirtualLocation` (the shared history-adaptation
// pipeline every `VirtualLocationSource` is read through) round-trips to
// the identical pathname/search it was built from — proven directly by
// `virtual-location.test.ts`'s own "round-trips through
// projectParamsToVirtualLocation" case. This is not the composed case's
// `route`-parameter convention reapplied to a fake entry; it is this pair
// of pure functions' own round-trip identity, reused so
// `adaptVirtualLocationHistory` (`./history-adaptation.js`) needs no
// standalone-specific branch of its own — every derivation past this
// source stays identical between the two modes, exactly as the algorithm's
// own Output requires ("the same router construction... independent of
// whether the consumer has created a route-ownership-signal observer").
