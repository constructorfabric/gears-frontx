 * `./standalone-history-source.js`). The resulting router matches only its
 * own virtual location — the pathname and search this package projected
 * from the occupant's own entry, or from the page's own address in
 * standalone mode — because `history` itself is already scoped to nothing
 * else; no separate code enforces that property. This same call is also
 * where FEATURE §3, Standalone Deployment, steps 4 and 5 land: the
 * standalone case runs through this identical function and
 * `EngineProvider` below, differing only in which `history` was adapted
 * (`./engine-provider-history.js`) — "the same construction path the
 * composed case uses" is this file, unmodified for standalone.

 * constructs; the router it returns is mounted separately, by

 * mount boundary and the same symmetric attach/destroy effect below,
 * applied to the already-constructed router's own `history` member (the
 * same adapted `RouterHistory` object either overload ultimately mounts
 * and tears down) instead of a separately supplied `history` prop —
 * `router` is expected stable for the lifetime of one mount, exactly like
 * `history` above.
 *
 * The contract this overload commits to is unconditional: `EngineProvider`
 * owns the lifecycle of whatever `history` the router it is given carries,
 * whether or not that history was built by this package's own adaptation.
 * A `router` constructed elsewhere with a consumer-owned, non-adapted
 * history still has that history's own `destroy()` called on unmount
 * (`attachAdaptedHistory` is a no-op for an object it never registered, so
 * the mismatched half of the pair costs nothing) — a caller who wants to
 * keep managing that history's lifecycle itself must mount the router
 * through a raw `RouterProvider` instead of this overload.

 * FEATURE §3, Teardown On Unmount, step 1 (`inst-when-unmount`): this
 * component is the mount boundary the FEATURE names — its own effect below
 * is the actual "WHEN...unmounted" moment, symmetric with construction
 * rather than a one-way teardown (N1): setup re-establishes the adapted
 * history's own internal `NavigationHistory` registration
 * (`attachAdaptedHistory`, a no-op when it is already active), and cleanup
 * releases it (`history.destroy()`, already documented idempotent). Making
 * the two true inverses of each other is what keeps React's own StrictMode
 * — which double-invokes an effect's setup/cleanup/setup on every
 * development mount — from leaving a still-mounted router's history dead:
 * the second setup re-does exactly what the cleanup undid, so a StrictMode
 * mount still ends with exactly one live subscription, and an actual
 * unmount still ends with zero.
