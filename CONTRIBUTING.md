## Branching Model (Gitflow)

| Branch | Lifecycle | Purpose | Publishes to |
|--------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `main` | permanent | Current stable major | `latest` npm dist-tag |
| `develop` | permanent | Active development | `alpha` npm dist-tag |
| `release/X.Y.Z` | short-lived | Release preparation (from develop → main) | `next` npm dist-tag |
| `release/vN` | long-lived | Maintenance line for major version N | `vN` npm dist-tag (e.g. `v1`) |
| `feature/*` | short-lived | Feature branches (from develop) | — |
| `hotfix/*` | short-lived | Hotfix branches (from main → main + develop) | — |

### Standard Workflow

1. Create a `feature/*` branch from `develop`
2. Make changes, commit, push, open PR targeting `develop`
3. After review and merge, CI publishes alpha versions
4. When ready for release, create `release/X.Y.Z` from `develop`
5. Finalize version bumps, merge `release/X.Y.Z` into `main`
6. CI publishes stable versions, merge back to `develop`

### Previous-Major Maintenance

When a new major is released, the previous major gets a long-lived `release/vN` branch:

1. When cutting major v2, create `release/v1` from the last v1 commit on `main`
2. To fix a bug in v1: branch `hotfix/*` from `release/v1`
3. PR targets `release/v1` → merge → CI publishes with `--tag v1`
4. If the fix also applies to v2, cherry-pick to `develop` or `main`

Users install old majors explicitly: `npm install @gears-frontx/react@v1`

## Versioning

The project is **pre-1.0** — backward compatibility is not guaranteed.

| Version format | Channel | Branch | Meaning |
|---------------|---------|--------|---------|
| `0.y.z-alpha.N` | `alpha` | `develop` | Development snapshot |
| `0.y.z-rc.N` | `next` | `release/X.Y.Z` | Release candidate |
| `0.y.z` | `latest` | `main` | Stable release |
| `N.y.z` | `vN` | `release/vN` | Previous major maintenance |

- **Minor bump** (`0.1.x` → `0.2.x`) — may contain breaking changes
- **Patch bump** (`0.1.0` → `0.1.1`) — non-breaking fixes/features
- **Alpha increment** (`alpha.0` → `alpha.1`) — each merge to develop

## Publishing

Publishing is automated via CI/CD. On push to a publishing branch, CI detects version changes and publishes affected packages.

### Branch-to-Channel Mapping

| Branch | Dist-tag | Trigger |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `develop` | `alpha` | Every merge |
| `release/X.Y.Z` | `next` | RC prep merges |
| `main` | `latest` | Release merges |
| `release/vN` | `vN` | Maintenance patches |

### Publish Order

Packages are published in dependency order:
1. L1 SDK: `@gears-frontx/state`, `@gears-frontx/mfes`, `@gears-frontx/api`, `@gears-frontx/i18n`
2. L2 Framework: `@gears-frontx/framework`
3. L3 React: `@gears-frontx/react`
4. Standalone: `@gears-frontx/studio`, `@gears-frontx/cli`

Each package is versioned independently within a single major version.

## Package Scope

- npm scope: `@gears-frontx/*`
- CLI binary: `frontx`
- Config file: `frontx.config.json`

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gears-frontx/frontx.git
cd frontx
npm ci
npm run build:packages
npm run dev
```

## Building

```bash
# Build all packages in layer order
npm run build:packages

# Build specific layer
npm run build:packages:sdk
npm run build:packages:framework
npm run build:packages:react
npm run build:packages:studio
npm run build:packages:cli
```

## Template Development Loop

[`template-shell/`](template-shell) is not a root workspace: it is a standalone npm project that pins `@gears-frontx/api`, `@gears-frontx/mfes` and `@gears-frontx/gts-plugin` to exact registry versions, so that a seeded project installs outside the monorepo. Those pins mean a plain `npm install` inside the template resolves the **published** alpha, not the sources you are editing.

After changing anything under `packages/api`, `packages/mfes` or `packages/gts-plugin`, relink before running the template:

```bash
npm run build:packages       # publish-shaped dist/ for the ecosystem packages
npm run dev:template:link    # point the template's node_modules at packages/* sources
cd template-shell && npm run dev
```

`dev:template:link` ([`scripts/link-template-ecosystem.mjs`](scripts/link-template-ecosystem.mjs)) only repoints those three directories inside the template's `node_modules`; it never writes `package.json` or `package-lock.json`, so nothing from the dev loop can leak into a seeded project. Skipping it is normally silent: the template builds and passes its checks against the published alpha, and local edits simply never appear.

> **Known issue — the link step is currently mandatory, not an optimisation.** The published `0.3.0-alpha.0` tarballs predate the move of `FRONTX_ACTION_*` into `@gears-frontx/gts-plugin` and the addition of `DomainContext.typeSystem` to `@gears-frontx/mfes`. `template-shell/packages/framework` already imports both from their new homes, so against the pins alone `npm run type-check` and `npm run build:packages` fail with type errors on those exports. `npm ci` and `npm run build:package` are unaffected. Running `dev:template:link` puts the local `dist/` in place and both go green; `npm run dev:template:link` prints the same warning. The clearing sequence is two merges: this branch bumps `mfes` and `gts-plugin` to `0.3.0-alpha.1`, which publishes the fixed surfaces, and a follow-up moves the template's pins onto them — a lockfile cannot resolve a tarball that does not exist yet. Until that second merge, linking is the only way to build the template, and a seeded project cannot build from the pins at all. Tracked on [#485](https://github.com/constructorfabric/gears-frontx/issues/485).

To go back to the pinned registry versions, run `npm ci` inside `template-shell`. There is no `--unlink`: the links replace published tarball *content*, which only npm can restore.

Two ways to lose the links without meaning to:

- **any `npm install` inside `template-shell`** — say, while adding a dependency — reifies the tree from the lockfile and silently puts the registry tarballs back. Relink afterwards.
- **`npm run clean:artifacts`** at the repo root removes `packages/*/dist`, so the links survive but point at nothing. `npm run build:packages` restores them; the link script refuses to run at all if the build is missing.

The dev loop uses symlinks on macOS and Linux and directory junctions on Windows, so no elevated shell or Developer Mode is required on any platform.

## Validation

```bash
# Repo-wide type checking (host app + workspace packages + nested MFEs)
npm run type-check:all

# Host app only (`tsconfig.json`; nested MFEs and package test tsconfigs run separately)
npm run type-check

# Linting
npm run lint

# Architecture checks
npm run arch:check
npm run arch:deps
```

### Unit tests

Run the full suite from the repo root with the monorepo fan-out runner ([`scripts/run-monorepo-unit-tests.mjs`](scripts/run-monorepo-unit-tests.mjs)):

```bash
npm run test:unit
npm run test:unit:watch
```

Every workspace that defines `test:unit`, plus the repo-root `scripts/` toolchain as the `repo-scripts` project, is exercised by that command. To narrow a run, pass the project name or a path to the runner: `npm run test:unit -- --project=cli`, or `npm run test:unit -- packages/cli/src/__tests__/resolver.test.ts` for a single file.

`scripts/` is not an npm workspace, so the runner cannot discover it from `package.json#workspaces` the way it finds everything else; it is registered explicitly in [`scripts/test-runner/discovery.mjs`](scripts/test-runner/discovery.mjs) and tested through [`vitest.scripts.config.mjs`](vitest.scripts.config.mjs). A new test file under `scripts/` needs no wiring, but a new *root-level* directory of tests does.

**Internal scripts (do not call directly):** Root [`package.json`](package.json) defines `_test:unit:host` and `_test:unit:host:watch` for the `repo-scripts` project; they exist so the monorepo runner can invoke Vitest where there is no workspace package. Agents and CI should use `npm run test:unit` / `test:unit:watch` instead.
