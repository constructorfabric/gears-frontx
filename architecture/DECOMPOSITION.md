## 1. Overview

This decomposition contains root-owned work packages plus temporary compatibility anchors required by the installed SDLC kit.

The root owns two behaviors:

- Ecosystem distribution and versioning policy.
- Ecosystem layer-partition governance.

The installed SDLC kit currently defines feature-entry identifiers only in DECOMPOSITION and routes DESIGN coverage through DECOMPOSITION. Compatibility anchors below are therefore limited to feature IDs, member owner pointers and compact ID-only coverage references for member-owned components, constraints and principles; the previous central member-detail index remains removed.

- Member artifact-chain accounting through enforced registration or path-scoped debt.
- CI-facing reporting for missing classification or missing accounting.

**Out of scope**:

### 2.21 [AI-Driven Project Scaffolding from Intent](../packages/cyber-pilot-kit-frontx/architecture/features/ai-project-scaffolding/) - HIGH

<!-- The [x] below is the cfs coverage rollup - this entry's references resolve
     and its coverage holds - and NOT a claim that the feature is implemented.
     Its FEATURE's own featstatus (`cpt-frontx-featstatus-ai-project-
     scaffolding`) is unchecked and governs implementation status: both entry
     points ship as documents rather than compiled modules, so no code marker
     pairs with their CDSL instructions and none may be checked. -->
- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-feature-ai-project-scaffolding`

**Owner**: Member-owned compatibility anchor only; behavior is defined in [FEATURE.md](../packages/cyber-pilot-kit-frontx/architecture/features/ai-project-scaffolding/FEATURE.md).

### 2.22 Template Territory Conversion to the Registration Contract - HIGH

- [ ] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-feature-template-territory-conversion`

**Purpose**: Convert the ecosystem's own pre-existing templates (`template-shell`, `template-mfe`) from their legacy manifest shape onto the current four-field registration contract, so both become registrable and applicable under `cpt-frontx-adr-thin-template-manifest`, `cpt-frontx-adr-whole-target-ownership`, and `cpt-frontx-adr-single-project-state-file` by direct conversion at the source rather than by relying on any runtime compatibility path. Until this conversion completes, zero templates in this repository are registrable under the current contract.

**Depends On**: `cpt-frontx-feature-template-manifest` (F11 — the four-field manifest contract both templates convert onto)

**Scope** — five concrete changes, across both templates:

1. Replace each legacy manifest (`schemaVersion` + `ownershipBoundaries`) with the current four-field shape: `name`, `version`, a required non-empty `description`, and `ownership.excludedSubtrees`.
2. Widen `template-shell`'s ownership from its current file-subset claim to whole-target ownership (its target minus its declared `excludedSubtrees`) — extending what it owns, or moving previously unclaimed root files into `projectOwnedRoots`. This is a **behavioural change requiring its own review**, not a mechanical manifest edit, and is tracked here rather than folded into item 1.
3. Remove both templates' own claim on `.frontx/ai/<manifest-name>/`; that bundle is a CLI-owned write (`cpt-frontx-adr-whole-target-ownership`), never template-owned.
4. Add `src-app/mfe_packages/` to `template-shell`'s `ownership.excludedSubtrees` (a well-formed target-relative directory path with the trailing `/` `cpt-frontx-adr-thin-template-manifest` requires) and stop carrying payload inside it.
5. Extract each template's authoring/dev-harness machinery (a dev-only `package.json` with `file:` overrides, local build tooling) out of the template directory entirely, leaving pure payload plus the manifest and the conventional AI-extension bundle (`cpt-frontx-adr-thin-template-manifest`, "More Information").

A registered name using `/` as a path-segment separator (an npm-scoped name, as both templates already use) is valid under the bundle-root prefix-uniqueness and non-empty-segment invariants `cpt-frontx-adr-thin-template-manifest` fixes for `name`.

**Out of scope**: Any change to the registration contract, the conflict-checker geometry, or any other ecosystem template; this entry converts exactly the two named templates.

**Note**: Template territory — the directories these manifests live in — sits outside this repository's `@cpt-` traceability chain (`cpt-frontx-adr-template-territory-traceability`); this entry is therefore a coordination work item tracking the conversion's completion, not a compatibility anchor into member architecture the way §2.10–§2.18 are.

### 2.23 Identifier Rename Wave for Post-Redesign Scope Drift - LOW

- [ ] `p3` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-feature-identifier-rename-wave`

**Purpose**: Rename four identifiers (one with its folder) whose literal names still describe scope the template-registration redesign retired, consolidating the "pending follow-up" notes each currently carries in its own isolated location into one tracked work item, per the precedent §2.22 sets for tracking a rename/conversion wave rather than scattering follow-up prose across unrelated sections.

**Depends On**: None — a pure identifier/folder rename with no behavioral, contract, or schema change.

**Scope** — four renames:

1. `cpt-frontx-feature-composed-provenance` (and its folder, `packages/cli/architecture/features/composed-provenance/`) — the name and folder describe transitive preset ("composed") resolution and a per-applied-template provenance record, both retired by this redesign; current scope is the single project-state document, registration, and ownership management (`cpt-frontx-feature-composed-provenance/FEATURE.md` §1.1).
2. `cpt-frontx-component-cli-provenance-recorder` — already renamed in [CLI DESIGN §4](../packages/cli/architecture/DESIGN.md) prose to "CLI Project State Store"; the identifier itself still names the retired per-instance provenance-record role.
3. `cpt-frontx-constraint-cli-per-template-provenance` — its name asserts a per-template provenance record; the constraint it now fixes is the opposite, a single document shared across every template ([CLI DESIGN §3.1](../packages/cli/architecture/DESIGN.md)).
4. `cpt-frontx-feature-upgrade-changeset` — its name asserts a file-level change-set (diff/merge/rollback) mechanism; that mechanism is explicitly deferred to a dedicated future decision ([CLI DESIGN §4](../packages/cli/architecture/DESIGN.md)), and this feature currently owns only the atomic name-level `origin`/`version` transition, not any change-set representation.

**Out of scope**: Any change to behavior, contract, or schema — renames only. The dedicated future decision on file-level change-set mechanics may itself settle whether item 4 keeps "change-set" once that mechanism actually exists, rather than this entry pre-empting that decision.

**Note**: Consolidates the "pending follow-up" notes at [composed-provenance/FEATURE.md §1.1](../packages/cli/architecture/features/composed-provenance/FEATURE.md), [CLI DESIGN §3.1](../packages/cli/architecture/DESIGN.md) (Domain Model table), and [CLI DESIGN §3.4](../packages/cli/architecture/DESIGN.md) (Applicability) into this one tracked item. Like §2.22, this is a coordination work item over identifier hygiene, not a compatibility anchor into member architecture the way §2.10–§2.18 are.

```

**Dependency Rationale**:

- `cpt-frontx-feature-gts-type-provider` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-type-substrate-port`: the GTS provider implements the opaque type-substrate port the runtime defines.
- `cpt-frontx-feature-mfe-registry` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-type-substrate-port`: the registry façade is built with the type-system provider injected through the port contract.
- `cpt-frontx-feature-mfe-loading` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-mfe-registry`: on-demand loading is orchestrated from the registry.
- `cpt-frontx-feature-mfe-host-communication` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-mfe-registry`: the capability bridge delegates to the registry.
- `cpt-frontx-feature-extension-domain-governance` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-mfe-registry`: admission and mount strategies act on registry-resolved extensions.
- `cpt-frontx-feature-extension-domain-governance` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-gts-type-provider`: action–behavior consistency validation at admission uses type-of resolution from the provider.
- `cpt-frontx-feature-mfe-isolation` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-mfe-registry`: isolated mounts are driven by the registry's load orchestration.
- `cpt-frontx-feature-mfe-isolation` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-mfe-loading`: isolation wraps the load execution path.
- `cpt-frontx-feature-template-manifest` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-template-resolution`: the manifest is read at install/scaffold through the resolver.
- `cpt-frontx-feature-cli-scaffolding` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-template-resolution`: scaffolding consumes templates from the resolved inventory.
- `cpt-frontx-feature-composed-provenance` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-cli-scaffolding`: this FEATURE owns the single project-state document (`.frontx/project.json`) that scaffolding/apply reads and writes at materialization time (ADR 0036).
- `cpt-frontx-feature-composed-provenance` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-template-resolution`: template registration (register/install) resolves through the same shared resolver, and the project-state store records the pinned origin it returns (ADR 0040).
- `cpt-frontx-feature-cli-scaffolding` also requires `cpt-frontx-feature-composed-provenance`: the conflict checker's geometry check — run by `assemble`, `apply`, `delete`, and `ownership add|remove` alike — reads already-applied `targets[]` and `projectOwnedRoots` out of the single project-state document `composed-provenance` owns. Read together with the `composed-provenance` → `cli-scaffolding` edge above, F12 and F13 genuinely depend on each other at feature altitude — the diagram in §3 marks this with the `(also ← F13)` annotation on F12 rather than a one-way arrow. This is not a defect: both features decompose the behavior of one CLI package sharing a single command surface, and the concrete component-level structure that makes the mutual dependency safe — which component reads, which writes, and when — is owned by the [CLI's member DESIGN §3.2](../packages/cli/architecture/DESIGN.md#32-component-model) (CLI Conflict Checker and CLI Project State Store).
- `cpt-frontx-feature-upgrade-changeset` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-composed-provenance`: the change-set diffs against the `templates[name] = {origin, version, targets[]}` entry in the single project-state document this FEATURE owns, not a per-instance provenance record; the unit of upgrade is the whole template name — all of its targets — applied atomically (ADR 0041).
- `cpt-frontx-feature-upgrade-changeset` also requires `cpt-frontx-feature-cli-scaffolding`: the engine applies an approved transition within each target's effective ownership, reusing the Conflict Checker's canonicalized geometry (`cpt-frontx-algo-cli-scaffolding-conflict-check`) rather than redefining it — the same reuse `composed-provenance` already cites for `ownership add` and `validate --project` above (§3, F12 ← F13 rationale).
- `cpt-frontx-feature-template-ai-extensions` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-ai-kit-packaging`: extensions activate into the base kit's capability set.
- `cpt-frontx-feature-template-ai-extensions` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-template-resolution`: discovery is triggered on template install (cross-package edge F16 ← F10).
- `cpt-frontx-feature-ai-upgrade-orchestration` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-upgrade-changeset`: orchestration drives the single CLI change-set engine (cross-package edge F17 ← F14).
- `cpt-frontx-feature-ai-upgrade-orchestration` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-ai-kit-packaging`: the orchestration workflow ships inside the base AI kit.
- `cpt-frontx-feature-cli-invocation` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-template-resolution`, `cpt-frontx-feature-template-manifest`, `cpt-frontx-feature-cli-scaffolding`, `cpt-frontx-feature-composed-provenance`, and `cpt-frontx-feature-upgrade-changeset`: the invocation surface is the cross-command aggregator that dispatches `frontx <command>` to each owning behavior; it sits above them in the graph and none depend back on it.
- `cpt-frontx-feature-ai-project-scaffolding` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-ai-kit-packaging` (its entry points ship in the base kit), `cpt-frontx-feature-template-manifest` (selection matches intent against manifest-declared descriptions), `cpt-frontx-feature-template-resolution` (the local inventory it selects over), `cpt-frontx-feature-cli-scaffolding` (the seed/add assembly it drives over the command surface), `cpt-frontx-feature-composed-provenance` (the applied set is reported from the single project-state document's `templates[name].targets`), and `cpt-frontx-feature-template-ai-extensions` (per-unit realization drives the applied templates' activated extension skills).
- `cpt-frontx-feature-telemetry-sdk` has no feature-level dependency: the package imports no other package in this ecosystem (`cpt-frontx-telemetry-constraint-standalone-boundary`), so it stands alone in the graph like `cpt-frontx-feature-ecosystem-distribution` and `cpt-frontx-feature-ecosystem-governance`.
- `cpt-frontx-feature-template-territory-conversion` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-template-manifest`: the conversion moves both legacy templates (`template-shell`, `template-mfe`) onto the four-field manifest contract F11 fixes; it is a coordination work item over template territory rather than a member-owned anchor (`cpt-frontx-adr-template-territory-traceability`), so it depends on F11 only and carries no dependents of its own in this graph.
- `cpt-frontx-feature-identifier-rename-wave` has no feature-level dependency: it renames four identifiers (and one folder) whose current owners are already fixed by `cpt-frontx-feature-composed-provenance` (F13) and `cpt-frontx-feature-upgrade-changeset` (F14); the rename touches only how those two FEATUREs and their components are cited, not what they do, so it stands alone in the graph like `cpt-frontx-feature-telemetry-sdk` above.

## 4. Known Validator Debt

The installed SDLC kit requires feature-entry definitions in root DECOMPOSITION and routes DESIGN coverage through DECOMPOSITION. The member compatibility anchors in this file are limited to feature IDs, owner pointers and compact ID-only component/constraint/principle coverage references; member purpose, scope, requirements, prose, flows, dependencies, algorithms, acceptance criteria and design decisions remain owned by member FEATURE and DESIGN files.

This debt is removable when the upstream or project-installed SDLC kit supports member-scoped DECOMPOSITION coverage and member-owned FEATURE identity.

Root requirement `cpt-frontx-fr-ui-framework-agnostic` (PRD:177) is realized through member-owned core-package boundaries (`cpt-frontx-adr-core-package-boundaries`) and is tracked in the MFE Runtime's own FEATURE-level requirements coverage, not in this file: compatibility anchors 2.1–2.7 carry no `Requirements Covered` field by convention (ID, Owner and optional Installed-kit coverage references only, matching every other member-owned anchor in this file), so this FR has no DECOMPOSITION-level coverage line. This is recorded here as debt rather than silently omitted; it is removable when the anchor convention is extended to carry a `Requirements Covered` field, or when the owning member FEATURE cites this root FR ID directly.
