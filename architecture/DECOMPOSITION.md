## 1. Overview

This decomposition contains root-owned work packages plus temporary compatibility anchors required by the installed SDLC kit.

The root owns two behaviors:

- Ecosystem distribution and versioning policy.
- Ecosystem layer-partition governance.

The installed SDLC kit currently defines feature-entry identifiers only in DECOMPOSITION and routes DESIGN coverage through DECOMPOSITION. Compatibility anchors below are therefore limited to feature IDs, member owner pointers and compact ID-only coverage references for member-owned components, constraints and principles; the previous central member-detail index remains removed.

### 2.21 [AI-Driven Project Scaffolding from Intent](../packages/cyber-pilot-kit-frontx/architecture/features/ai-project-scaffolding/) - HIGH

<!-- The [x] below is the cfs coverage rollup - this entry's references resolve
     and its coverage holds - and NOT a claim that the feature is implemented.
     Its FEATURE's own featstatus (`cpt-frontx-featstatus-ai-project-
     scaffolding`) is unchecked and governs implementation status: both entry
     points ship as documents rather than compiled modules, so no code marker
     pairs with their CDSL instructions and none may be checked. -->
- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-frontx-feature-ai-project-scaffolding`

**Owner**: Member-owned compatibility anchor only; behavior is defined in [FEATURE.md](../packages/cyber-pilot-kit-frontx/architecture/features/ai-project-scaffolding/FEATURE.md).

```

**Dependency Rationale**:

- `cpt-frontx-feature-gts-type-provider` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-type-substrate-port`: the GTS provider implements the opaque type-substrate port the runtime defines.
- `cpt-frontx-feature-mfe-registry` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-type-substrate-port`: the registry façade is built with the type-system provider injected through the port contract.
- `cpt-frontx-feature-mfe-loading` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-mfe-registry`: on-demand loading is orchestrated from the registry.
- `cpt-frontx-feature-mfe-host-communication` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-mfe-registry`: the capability bridge delegates to the registry.
- `cpt-frontx-feature-extension-domain-governance` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-mfe-registry`: admission and mount strategies act on registry-resolved extensions.
- `cpt-frontx-feature-extension-domain-governance` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-gts-type-provider`: action–behavior consistency validation at admission uses type-of resolution from the provider.
- `cpt-frontx-feature-mfe-isolation` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-mfe-registry`: isolated mounts are driven by the registry's load orchestration.
- `cpt-frontx-feature-mfe-isolation` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-mfe-loading`: isolation wraps the load execution path.
- `cpt-frontx-feature-template-manifest` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-template-resolution`: the manifest is read at install/scaffold through the resolver.
- `cpt-frontx-feature-cli-scaffolding` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-template-resolution`: scaffolding consumes templates from the resolved inventory.
- `cpt-frontx-feature-composed-provenance` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-cli-scaffolding`: this FEATURE owns the single project-state document (`.frontx/project.json`) that scaffolding/apply reads and writes at materialization time (ADR 0036).
- `cpt-frontx-feature-composed-provenance` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-template-resolution`: template registration (register/install) resolves through the same shared resolver, and the project-state store records the pinned origin it returns (ADR 0040).
- `cpt-frontx-feature-cli-scaffolding` also requires `cpt-frontx-feature-composed-provenance`: the conflict checker's geometry check — run by `assemble`, `apply`, `delete`, and `ownership add|remove` alike — reads already-applied `targets[]` and `projectOwnedRoots` out of the single project-state document `composed-provenance` owns. Read together with the `composed-provenance` → `cli-scaffolding` edge above, this looks like a two-node cycle (F12↔F13) at feature altitude; it is not one at component altitude. The two edges name different components exchanging data at different points of the same command, not one component instantiating the other: the edge from `cli-scaffolding` is the conflict checker (a read-only geometry consumer) reading a value out of the project state store; the edge from `composed-provenance` is that same state store (the write target) being called into by the assembler at materialization time. Neither package imports the other's module at compile time (`cpt-frontx-component-cli` §3.4 has no internal-dependency edges); both interactions are two components of one CLI package cooperating within a single command invocation, not a package-level circular dependency.
- `cpt-frontx-feature-upgrade-changeset` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-composed-provenance`: the change-set diffs against the `templates[name] = {origin, version, targets[]}` entry in the single project-state document this FEATURE owns, not a per-instance provenance record; the unit of upgrade is the whole template name — all of its targets — applied atomically (ADR 0041).
- `cpt-frontx-feature-template-ai-extensions` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-ai-kit-packaging`: extensions activate into the base kit's capability set.
- `cpt-frontx-feature-template-ai-extensions` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-template-resolution`: discovery is triggered on template install (cross-package edge F16 ← F10).
- `cpt-frontx-feature-ai-upgrade-orchestration` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-upgrade-changeset`: orchestration drives the single CLI change-set engine (cross-package edge F17 ← F14).
- `cpt-frontx-feature-ai-upgrade-orchestration` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-ai-kit-packaging`: the orchestration workflow ships inside the base AI kit.
- `cpt-frontx-feature-cli-invocation` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-template-resolution`, `cpt-frontx-feature-template-manifest`, `cpt-frontx-feature-cli-scaffolding`, `cpt-frontx-feature-composed-provenance`, and `cpt-frontx-feature-upgrade-changeset`: the invocation surface is the cross-command aggregator that dispatches `frontx <command>` to each owning behavior; it sits above them in the graph and none depend back on it.
- `cpt-frontx-feature-ai-project-scaffolding` requires `cpt-frontx-feature-ai-kit-packaging` (its entry points ship in the base kit), `cpt-frontx-feature-template-manifest` (selection matches intent against manifest-declared descriptions), `cpt-frontx-feature-template-resolution` (the local inventory it selects over), `cpt-frontx-feature-cli-scaffolding` (the seed/add assembly it drives over the command surface), `cpt-frontx-feature-composed-provenance` (the applied set is reported from the single project-state document's `templates[name].targets`), and `cpt-frontx-feature-template-ai-extensions` (per-unit realization drives the applied templates' activated extension skills).

## 4. Known Validator Debt

The installed SDLC kit requires feature-entry definitions in root DECOMPOSITION and routes DESIGN coverage through DECOMPOSITION. The member compatibility anchors in this file are limited to feature IDs, owner pointers and compact ID-only component/constraint/principle coverage references; member purpose, scope, requirements, prose, flows, dependencies, algorithms, acceptance criteria and design decisions remain owned by member FEATURE and DESIGN files.

This debt is removable when the upstream or project-installed SDLC kit supports member-scoped DECOMPOSITION coverage and member-owned FEATURE identity.
