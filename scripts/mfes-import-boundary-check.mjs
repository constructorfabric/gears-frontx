/**
 * MFES Import-Boundary CI Guard (#540, ADR-0003 confirmation section).
 *
 * ADR-0003 (`mfe-runtime-public-surface`) shaped `@gears-frontx/mfes` around an
 * abstract facade: consumers depend on `MfeRegistry` and obtain instances
 * through `createMfeRegistryFactory().build({ typeSystem })`, while the
 * concrete implementation classes — the registry, the factory, and the
 * coordination machinery behind them (mount management, lifecycle
 * orchestration, mediator, bridge wiring, state) — stay internal. The ADR's
 * confirmation section promised a continuous-integration check for that
 * boundary; #540 is what happens without one: the barrel quietly shipped
 * `DefaultMfeRegistry` and its siblings for months, and template-shell grew a
 * `new DefaultMfeRegistryFactory()` call nobody noticed.
 *
 * The forbidden set is a NAMING RULE, not a class list: every concrete default
 * implementation in the runtime is named `Default<Contract>` (or, for the
 * bridge factory, `<Contract>Default`), and the abstract contracts never carry
 * that affix. A static list of class names would be the same duplicated
 * knowledge this guard exists to prevent — a new `DefaultFooManager` would be
 * born unguarded. The rule guards both sides of the boundary:
 *
 *  - THE BARREL: `packages/mfes/src/index.ts` must not export a binding that
 *    matches the concrete-implementation naming rule on EITHER side of an
 *    `as` alias, and must not use wildcard re-exports at all. This is the
 *    half that makes the drift structurally impossible to reintroduce,
 *    whether or not a consumer exists yet.
 *  - THE CONSUMERS: no file outside `packages/mfes` may import a
 *    concrete-implementation name from `@gears-frontx/mfes`, and no file may
 *    deep-import a subpath (`@gears-frontx/mfes/...`) at all — a deep import
 *    reaches past the barrel into exactly the internals the barrel exists to
 *    hide. Aliasing does not launder a name: the ORIGINAL binding is checked,
 *    not the local alias, and `import type` counts — a type-level dependency
 *    on a concrete class couples the consumer to its shape just the same.
 *
 * Zero scanned files is a hard failure, never a vacuous pass (same rule as
 * `ecosystem-pin-drift-check.mjs`): a walk that stops matching means the guard
 * is broken, and a human needs to see that as red.
 *
 * Why a script and not eslint `no-restricted-imports`/`no-restricted-exports`:
 * template territory (`template-shell`, `template-mfe`) now lives in its own
 * repository (constructorfabric/gears-frontx-templates) with its own ESLint
 * config, so a root-owned rule here could never reach it even were it in this
 * tree; and even where a template does lint itself, that config is a file the
 * template is free to edit, not a place a repo-wide boundary can durably live.
 *
 * CLI entry: `node scripts/mfes-import-boundary-check.mjs` (exit 0 on success).
 * Wired into `npm run policy:mfes-import-boundary` and
 * `.github/workflows/main.yml`. Core logic is exported for unit tests in
 * `scripts/mfes-import-boundary-check.test.mjs`.

 *    says). Both sides of an `as` alias are checked — `DefaultX as Y` still
 *    hands consumers the concrete constructor under a laundered name, and `X
 *    as DefaultY` puts a concrete name in the public vocabulary.
 *  - A wildcard re-export, `export * from '…'` (prohibited outright: nobody
 *    can review what crosses a barrel that doesn't name its exports, and
 *    this guard cannot resolve them without becoming a module-graph walker).
 *  - A direct declaration in the barrel itself — `export class
