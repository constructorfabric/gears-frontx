/**
 * Ecosystem Pin-Drift CI Guard (#493 work item 3).
 *
 * `packages/gts-plugin` pins `@gears-frontx/mfes` to an exact registry
 * version - an intra-ecosystem exact pin that drifts with a bad blame radius:
 * a version bump to `packages/mfes/package.json` that misses that pin site
 * installs two different MFE runtime copies into one tree, which is the one
 * thing a single-runtime framework cannot survive (reviewer ask on #492).
 *
 * Nothing about this check is a static list - not the package set, not the
 * file paths. Every one of those lists would be the same duplicated knowledge
 * the guard exists to prevent, and #496 (which added `packages/telemetry`
 * while a related change was in review) is exactly the kind of drift a static
 * list would have missed. So everything is discovered structurally, via
 * `ecosystem-packages.mjs`:
 *
 *  - WHICH PACKAGES are a version truth: every `packages/*` manifest.
 *  - WHICH SITES to compare: every dependency field of every `packages/*`
 *    root manifest that names an ecosystem-scope package at an exact
 *    registry version.
 *
 * Historical note: this guard used to also walk every template at the repo
 * root (a directory carrying `frontx-template.json`), since templates pinned
 * these same packages to exact registry versions (#485/#501). Templates now
 * live in their own repository (`constructorfabric/gears-frontx-templates`)
 * with their own pin-drift coverage, so that half of this guard retired with
 * them; what remains is the ecosystem-internal half, which is still a real
 * failure mode on its own (`gts-plugin` pinning `mfes`, above).
 *
 * Every failure mode is reported through the exit code with a message naming the
 * file - an unreadable manifest, a malformed one, a pin nothing can verify - so
 * a red build never reads as a broken script.
 *
 * CLI entry: `node scripts/ecosystem-pin-drift-check.mjs` (exit 0 on success).
 * Core logic is exported for unit tests in
 * `scripts/ecosystem-pin-drift-check.test.mjs`.
