/**
 * What this repo's FrontX ecosystem IS - DERIVED from `packages/*` manifests
 * on disk, never declared.
 *
 * The predecessor of this module declared it: `['api', 'mfes', 'gts-plugin']`,
 * one constant shared by the pin-drift CI guard and (formerly) a dev-link
 * script so the two could not disagree. Sharing was right; the array was the
 * bug. #496 added `packages/telemetry` while a related change was in review,
 * and nothing noticed: a manifest pinning `@gears-frontx/telemetry` at a
 * stale version was silently unchecked. A list a human must remember to edit
 * is exactly the duplicated knowledge this module exists to prevent, so there
 * is no package array here at all.
 *
 * ## The ecosystem truth map
 *
 * Every `packages/*` manifest contributes `name -> version`. Not a curated
 * subset: `cli` and `cyber-pilot-kit-frontx` are never installed by a
 * downstream consumer, but including them costs nothing and makes a pin on
 * them verifiable rather than unverifiable. A `packages/*` directory with NO
 * manifest is skipped - a stray directory or a cleaned build output is not a
 * package. A manifest that IS there but cannot be read, cannot be parsed, or
 * declares no `name`/`version` FAILS CLOSED naming the file: an unusable
 * manifest must never read as "this package has no version to compare
 * against", which is indistinguishable from "none of its pin sites drifted".
 *
 * ## A pin on a name the truth map does not have
 *
 * FAILS LOUDLY, naming the site - a pin this repo cannot verify is not a pin
 * this repo may assume correct. Deleting `packages/api/package.json` is what
 * makes that rule load-bearing: `@gears-frontx/api` drops out of the truth
 * map, and without this rule every pin on it would quietly stop being
 * compared (`findDriftedSites` cannot distinguish "no truth entry" from
 * "matches"). With it, the missing manifest surfaces at the pin sites that
 * depend on it.
 *
 * The remaining exception is a name the scanned tree DEFINES itself, which
 * npm resolves locally through a workspace whatever range it carries, so no
 * registry version exists for it to drift from - `internal/*`
 * (`@gears-frontx/eslint-config`, `@gears-frontx/depcruise-config`) is
 * exactly that case for this repo's own root `workspaces`.
 *
 * The npm scope itself is derived from the truth map's own names, so not even
 * the string `@gears-frontx` is written down here.
 *
 * Historical note: templates (`template-shell`, `template-mfe`,
 * `template-design-guardrails`) used to live in this repository and pinned
 * these packages to exact registry versions; this module also folded in each
 * template's own published identity and workspace members on top of
 * `packages/*` (#501). Templates now live in their own repository
 * (`constructorfabric/gears-frontx-templates`) with their own pin-drift
 * coverage, so that folding-in no longer applies here - the truth map is
 * `packages/*` alone.
 *
 * Consumers: `ecosystem-pin-drift-check.mjs` (compares every intra-ecosystem
 * pin site against the truth map); `version-bump-on-change-check.mjs` (reuses
 * `readEcosystemPackages` to enumerate the package roots its CI gate governs,
 * narrowed further there to the non-`private` ones).
