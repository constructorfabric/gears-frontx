/**
 * Makes `Template Validate`'s composed install possible on a pull request that
 * bumped an ecosystem package: where a template pins a version the registry
 * does not carry yet, the pin is repointed at a tarball this checkout produces
 * with `npm pack`, and put back the moment the install is done.
 *
 * ## The failure this exists for
 *
 * `policy:version-bump-on-change` requires a `packages/*` manifest's `version`
 * to move in the same pull request that changes that package's `src/`, and the
 * templates pin `@gears-frontx/*` to exact registry versions, so the same pull
 * request also moves every pin site onto a version that only the post-merge
 * `publish-packages.yml` run will ever publish. `Template Validate` then
 * resolves those pins from the real registry and exits before the tree it
 * validates exists:
 *
 *     npm error code ETARGET
 *     npm error notarget No matching version found for @gears-frontx/ui-kit@0.4.0-alpha.2
 *
 * PR #598 is the third instance of that class - `0.4.0-alpha.0` and
 * `0.4.0-alpha.1` were the first two - and every instance is a correctly-bumped
 * pull request that is red by construction, with nothing wrong in it.
 *
 * ## The criterion, and why it has exactly three branches
 *
 * Per exact-registry-version pin site in the tree under validation, naming a
 * package THIS repo builds under `packages/*`:
 *
 *  1. the registry answers with that version -> nothing happens, the ordinary
 *     install resolves the published tarball, and the drift that pin may carry
 *     stays this job's to catch;
 *  2. the registry does not have it AND it equals the version
 *     `packages/<dir>/package.json` declares -> the pin names the artifact this
 *     very checkout would publish, so the checkout supplies it;
 *  3. the registry does not have it and it does NOT equal the local version ->
 *     LOUD REFUSAL naming the package, the pin and the local version. That is a
 *     mistyped or stale pin (`policy:template-pin-drift` owns that class), and
 *     substituting anything for it would mask it behind a green install.
 *
 * A network or registry failure is NOT branch 2. Only npm's own `E404` answer
 * counts as "this version does not exist"; any other way the probe can end -
 * an unreachable registry, a 401, an unparseable body - refuses with its own
 * reason, because "we could not ask" must never install as "the answer is no".
 *
 * ## Why an empty result here is success, unlike its sibling
 *
 * `pin-template-ecosystem-to-local.mjs` fails when it finds nothing to
 * substitute, because rewriting pins is that script's only reason to run.
 * This one is conditional by design: on any pull request that did not bump a
 * pinned package - the overwhelming majority - every pin resolves and doing
 * nothing is the correct outcome. What still fails closed is finding no
 * GOVERNED PIN SITE AT ALL in the tree: the composed tree is known to pin this
 * repo's `packages/*`, so an empty scan means the tree argument or the
 * derivation is wrong, not that the step is unnecessary.
 *
 * ## Why `npm pack` and not a `file:` path into `packages/*`
 *
 * A `file:` specifier pointing at a package DIRECTORY installs a link to the
 * working tree, so the consumer sees whatever is on disk - including source
 * `.npmignore`d out of a release. That is the right trade for
 * `template-drift.yml`, whose whole point is to test the working tree. It is
 * the wrong one here: this job exists to validate what a seeded project
 * INSTALLS, so the substitute has to be the artifact `npm publish` would upload.
 * `npm pack` produces exactly that - `files`, `.npmignore` and the
 * `prepack`/`prepare` lifecycle all applied - which is why an unbuilt package
 * is refused rather than packed: a tarball missing its entry point installs
 * green and fails at import.
 *
 * ## Why a post-merge run never substitutes
 *
 * Not by the criterion alone. On the `develop` push that merges the pull
 * request, `main.yml` and `publish-packages.yml` start together, so for a few
 * minutes the bumped version is still absent from the registry AND still equal
 * to the local one - branch 2 would fire and paper over a publish that had not
 * happened yet, or failed. The guarantee is therefore in the workflow, not
 * here: the composition step calls this script only on `pull_request`, and
 * `main.yml` runs on nothing but `main`/`develop` pushes and pull requests
 * against them. On a push, an unresolvable pin is a real publish failure and
 * stays red.
 *
 * ## Scope
 *
 * Only pin sites in fields npm materialises (`INSTALLED_DEPENDENCY_FIELDS`) and
 * only names this repo builds under `packages/*`. A pin on a name the composed
 * tree DEFINES - `@gears-frontx/react` and the rest of `template-shell/packages/*`,
 * or the shell's own identity - resolves through the workspace and never
 * reaches the registry, so it is not this script's business. A pin on a name
 * that is neither is `policy:template-pin-drift`'s to refuse as unverifiable.
 *
 * ## Where the tree is
 *
 * `--tree` is a PATH, not a directory name under the repo, and the tarballs are
 * packed INTO that tree. Both template steps install from a copy placed outside
 * the checkout (#586), so the tree this rewrites lives in `$RUNNER_TEMP` and
 * only `packages/*` and the `npm pack` invocation still refer to the repo.
 * Keeping the tarballs inside the tree is what makes every `file:` specifier a
 * short relative path within it, instead of one climbing out of `$RUNNER_TEMP`
 * and back into the workspace.
 *
 * Core logic is exported for unit tests: every process and registry effect
 * arrives through an injected seam, and only `runCli` supplies the real ones.
 *
 * CLI entry (CI runtime only - it shells out to `npm` by bare name):
 *   node scripts/pin-unpublished-ecosystem-to-local-pack.mjs --tree <path>
 *   node scripts/pin-unpublished-ecosystem-to-local-pack.mjs --tree <path> --restore
